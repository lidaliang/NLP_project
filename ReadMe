In this project, I created a web-app called staReviewer.com that uses natural language processing to understand
people's discussion about specialized products on online forums.
The data is scrapes from the world's largest forum for amateure astromoners, cloudynights.com. 
We train two models that takes a post text as input, 
the sentiment model discovers people's feelings and the relevance model discovers whether people would like to see this post.

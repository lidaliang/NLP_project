Are they really worth the price (despite being manufactured in Taiwan for some of them) or do you pay mega premium prices just because of the Televue tag?. Honest and ego-free replies please!.,0
"If you want a lunar instrument mainly, then yes..",0
I say it depends on the person and series.. I've tried all the 30ish mm eyepieces and nothing can match the 31T5 IMO.. Closest was probably the ES 30mm 82 but i found it lacked sharpness and had a greyish background.. Ethos I found the same and have now sold my ES 100's. The ES are a tad more comfortable to use however.. These are subtle differences but are noticeable.. Mike.,0
"Not on the used market... A lot of what you're paying for with Tele Vue eye pieces is good correction in fast scopes. I use fairly simple eye pieces in my slow scopes and enjoy the views just fine. For example, I have the three old Orion Optiluxe eye pieces (32mm, 40mm and 50mm). In my f/10 and slower scopes they do well. In friends' f/6 and faster scopes they are terrible. Those friends have 41mm Panoptics and 31mm Naglers.. I'd also read somewhere that when Al Nagler was asked about other companies cloning Tele Vue products, he said he wasn't worried because they'd never duplicate Tele Vue coatings. So perhaps there is also a premium for coatings..",0
It is a well known phenomenon that people feel a wine taste better if they think it is more expensive. I was thinking the only way to settle whether TV is overpriced is to conduct a blind shoot-out of various eyepiece at matching focal lengths and equipment where the eyepiece makers/model is hidden from the observers. The results of such an experiment would be interesting to say the least.,0
"I don't think they're overpriced, though I don't own any of them. They are extremely good eyepieces, right at the very top of the ""food chain"" and I think it's OK for them to cost somewhat more.. Myself, I am on a very limited budget, so I buy ES, when I want wide-field eyepieces, but if I could afford it, I would go with Televue and not look back. I do have a Televue Paracorr, which I am extremely fond of.. Clear skies!Thomas, Denmark.",0
"I personally can't justify TeleVue price tags with my current level of experience. The way I see it, they're only worth the premium price if you can appreciate the benefits they provide. Inexperienced users, such as myself, are not likely to notice a drastic difference in perceived transmission or aberration correction properties, so they're only worth it if you know what you're looking for.. My personal approach is to start out with comfortable mid-range eyepieces as seen in my signature (Baader, Vixen, Explore Scientific) and use them until I develop enough observing experience to warrant spending the extra cash on TV and other premium brands. I would like to first exhaust the utility of my affordable kit before I fork over double to triple the cost for premium glass..",0
"In other words, posters #4,5 and 6 don't own any TV ep's..",0
"If they were overpriced, they wouldn't sell any and they would go out of the eyepiece business..",0
"I suppose the answer is they sell enough to perform development and bring new products to market. They seem to come up with a lot of new ideas. The company is doing something right and its bread and butter is selling eyepieces.. To counter the comment that haters aren't owners.. I own a pairs of 8 Radians, 16T5, 22 and 24 mm Pans and a 41 Pan. I've tried Ethos and the 31 T5. I also have pairs of 6, 10 and 14 Delos.... Apart from the Delos, the only Televue eyepieces I really like are the 22 Pans. and they're not made any more.. I doubt Al actually cares - he already has my money.",0
"Me too. I used a pair of Plossls and a barlow for decades and was perfectly happy with what I could see. Eventually, I began to consider upgrading to some GSO widefields in a 2"" barrel.. I oncehada conversation where I made this very statement. It wasat a star party one afternoon a few years back. About four hours later, a set of Ethos eyepieces was sitting in my lap after my raffle ticket number came up. I cannot speak for others as to whether TV is worth the premium price. But you WILL be able to notice the difference!.",0
"Hi,. Some context - I'm a (glasses wearing) visual-only observer and focus exclusively on DSOs.. I own a number of TV (Delos, Panoptics, Naglers & 1 Ethos) eyepieces - some I got used, the rest I paid retail.. Over the years, I've tried other EP manufacturers - I kept none. What I didn't give away, got tossed. You did ask for honesty, yes?. Do I think my TVs were overpriced? Nope! Otherwise, I wouldn't have bought them, nor would I still own them Best..,. skybsd.",0
"Compared to other things, astronomy always seems to carry high prices for its gear. These eyepieces are marketed toward people who can afford them and they seem to sell well. There are other options if you don't want to spend that kind of money. You can get most of the way there with other brands of eyepieces.. Anyone who ridicules you for not having them or says you're not really doing astronomy unless you have them is being childish.. I have a feeling that you're going to get your face bitten off for asking this question though..",0
"They are not overpriced for me. I personally enjoywide field eyepieces (100 degrees). I havetriedother brands and Televue eyepieces are consistently sharper in the outer edges of the view.The others? Not so much. It's as simple as that for me. YMMV.. Cheers,. Ron.",0
"I believe the standard (and applicable) reply is:. If you have to ask, then, yes, they are.",0
"Actually, not true, at least in the case of Poster #4. What I don't have are:.  - the long focal length Naglers or Panoptics, as I like my Optiluxes just fine. I do find myself coveting the now discontinued 26mm, though. My opinion would be different if I had an f/5 scope, too..  - the Ethos. I can take in the Nagler field just fine, but the Ethos field is too big for me..  - the Delos or DeLites, as I'm happy with the eye pieces I have.. I do have:.  - some Naglers; the 17mm is magical and got the whole ""Nagler fever"" thing started for me. The view of M3 in my refractor was just too much to ignore..  - some Radians.  - some Plossls, I especially like the smoothies which I use with my driveway scope at home.  - two classics: a 13T1 and 24mm wide field. A bit of functional history that provide proof to me that Tele Vue's current eye pieces are demonstrably better than their old eye pieces (except for the Plossls, the smoothies are cool)..",0
"Evaluating an eyepiece is not a subjective judgment like wine is.. With an eyepiece, there are definite, observable aberrations, distortions, phenomena, one can objectively evaluate an eyepiece for field curvature, off axis astigmatism at faster focal ratios, scattering and ghosting. The uniformity of the illumination across the field of view, the field of view, the eye relief, angular magnification distortion... Myself, in the comarisons i have made between TeleVue eyepieces and others is that in my Scopes, which are generally on the fast side, TV eyepieces are sharper at the edge of the field, they suffer from less scatter than similar eyepieces, the field is evenly illuminated without the bright edge that some eyepieces are know for.. I think TeleVue makes excellent eyepieces and sells them at a reasonable price. I don't think Uncle Al has secret Swiss bank accounts, he has made a comfortable living from conceiving, designing and providing the most innovative eyepieces the hobby has seen. Hopefully he gets his just due and those copying his designs don't take too much business away.. I think Thomas Jensen was right on target. They're right at the top but there are eyepieces that are quite good but more affordable.  Myself, I am thrifty by nature but in my retirement years, amateur astronomy is my main interest. I am fortunate enough to have some very nice telescopes and having a nice set of TeleVue eyepieces is a luxury that I can afford. But back to Thomas, he has a good set of eyepieces but more importantly an amazing set of eyes, what he can see..oh my.. I'd gladly trade my eyepieces for his if I could also end up with eyes like his in the bargain.. Jon.",0
"Hopefully no one ridicules anyone in regards to their equipment.  Myself, I have been fortunate to acquire some quite nice equipment. It has taken around 20 years.. Not quickly.. But I very much respect and admire those of us who use basic equipment and use it effectively. Sometimes I think I am the guy with the fastest car on the track but I'm the slowest driver.. Jon.",0
"I brought up this point only because I seen endless maker vs maker in forums with no resolution in sight. (I've read some who commented that $10 Vites 26mm held its own vs Pans and so on). Given the limited resources of time and money most of us have, it would be nice to see if TV or other premium brands stand up to scrutiny of a blind test, however subjective that test might be..",0
"Are TV ep's over priced? I would say.... No, if you can afford them. Yes, if you can't afford them.. Right now, for me, they are over priced, but I don't care as I am happy with what I have..",0
"This seems to be a question regarding just about any Premium brand piece of gear, scope or eyepiece. Because TV so ubiquitous, it seems to get this question asked more often.  I can understand this feeling myself. When i started out I bought a 10 inch Orion dob, an 35mm panoptic and a 7 mm Nagler.  I distinctly remember feeling a bit uneasy that the two EP's I bought cost more than the telescope at the time. Over the years, I have added a few more TV's to my collection as well as a set of Brandons and I feel they are all worth what they are charged for retail. I can absolutely tell the difference in performance, and here is the important part of the sentence, that difference is worth it TO ME PERSONALLY.  I am in a position that I can afford it, and have progressed enough in the hobby where small differences in clarity and contrast really stand out to me. That being said, I ALSO own a bunch of very fine University Optics Orthos and ERFLEs that I use often and I can recommend to anyone. They are budget friendly and their quality is really quite good, much better in my opinion than the run of the mill chinese Plossl clones(and often cheaper!). I have a Surplus Shed special 53 mm that I got for I think 20 dollars, that has sufficiently quelled my desire for getting the TV 55 mm Plossl. I am sure as the sun rises that the TV would be better, but for what I use that surplus shed for, it is sufficient given my budget constraints.. As to the following comment posted above: ""Anyone who ridicules you for not having them or says you're not really doing astronomy unless you have them is being childish."". That is certainly true for ANY piece of gear!. I can have as much fun with my 120mm Synta Achromat as I do with my 5 inch AP Starfire.  It is not about the gear, it is about looking at and appreciating what is in the Sky!  Very often there is too much ridicule going on either for or against one piece of gear or another. It is all very silly. Buy what you can afford and get out as much as you can, and don't look back or second guess.  You will be much happier in the end. JMD.",0

I Say AMEN AGAIN!  JMD.,0
"Yes & no ,. consideing my most expensive televue was the 21 ethos at £420 , bought a few years ago when televue had their big sale I got mine a bit cheaper on top of that off German eBay just before the end of the sale.. If you're lucky enough to get them at that price then they are cheap as chips, they are very expensive now but I would say they're worth saving for..",0
"I have Radians, Naglers of different types and focal lengths, of which nearly all were bought used.  I think everyone acknowledges that most new Astronomy gear are priced to the limit that the Dealers think we can take.. Televue ep's are expensive but whether they are over priced is debatable,. although they come close in the context that it is hard to justify the benefit of getting an ep around £600/£800.  I know astronomy is a fairly small market compared to other stuff like domestic electricals, etc, and that manufacturers and deals need to cover running costs as well as R&D but sometimes stuff is over priced.  Having said that, I'm a freshwater fisherman, and some of that stuff is definitely overpriced.   So is Televue gear expensive.......yep, but worth it.  I try to buy good used ep's as much as possible and have had a lot of, to me, bargains, and usually can justify it to my wallet.  But it is nice to fantasise about those ep's, or whatever, which are out of reach temporarily or permanently due to the expense......you've got to be able to dream!!.",0
"Yes and No?...........I agree with you, Nevy,......well, kind of, sort of Yes and No.",0
"Well said , I think",0
"I don't have any TV eyepieces. I don't have any fast scopes. My scopes are F/10, F/14 and F/12, and F/6.5. Lesser quality eyepieces perform very well in my scopes. Or maybe I don't yet know what I'm missing. I only observe on tracking mounts and prefer modest fields for planetary observing.  And I've only recently really got back into the hobby after a roughly 20-year hiatus.  There are lots of things I've wanted to buy in the past year, and modern mounts and a Mak and a 80EDF refractor were higher priorities for me.  Plus, I tend to try to be thrifty.. Nonetheless, I don't see TV as overpriced. I realize that there is a big difference between optics that are pretty good and optics that are really good.  The difference between a cheap 70-200mm zoom camera lens and a high-end 70-200mm 2.8 are significant, but so is the difference in price.  However, you reach a point where incremental gains are only achieved with more substantial increases in price.. Moreover, I sincerely appreciate the leadership Televue has provided in the history.  When I started in this hobby, plossls seemed exotic and high-end.  Widefield eyepieces outside of Erfls and Konigs were a rarity and their performance wasn't the greatest.  Now plossls are considered low-end. 60-degree eyepieces of excellent quality are widely available and very affordable.  And we have numerous choices in the 68-70, 80-92, and even 100-degree classes.  It is my opinion that a big reason we have all these choices is that Televue has set the mark high, and left enough of a gap for other manufacturers to aim a bit lower and a bit more affordably. For this, I am most thankful.. I hope to have some TV eyepieces in the future, but that purchase probably won't come until I buy a scope at F/5 or lower. But some day, I will build the computerized Dob that I'm designing in my head, and to get the most possible out of it, I will need that 31mm Nagler....",0
"Thing is to find something you like and stick with it, unless your needs change. As for prices, maybe. Its sort of like automobiles. If all you want to do is get from point A to point B then anything from a Kia to a Prius will do. On the other hand if you want to enjoy the trip maybe a Corvette or a Mercedes is what you want.. I worked for Gary Hand for years and as a result I got first crack at anything used that came in. I looked thru a ton of premium eyepieces over time. A long time ago (late 60's) I settled on a then new set of UO Pro orthos plus the 16mm Konig and until the 90's I was happy with them. Isuffered fromboth near-sightedness and astigmatism and it did not really bother me. But at that time I decided to sell off all the ones I had and get ones with a minimum of 20mm of eye relief so I could use my glasses and get a better view. At the time that meant TV Radians, Pentax XLs, and Vixen LV/LVWs.Tried lots of them out. Owned a few of each. Ended up settling on a set of Pentax XLs. Still have them. Yes there are better ones out there. But considering my issues am I going to gain much? No, because I really can't get my eye close enough to use anything over about 70 degrees. I did not find the Pentax XWs were that much better thru my eyes to pay a big premium on. And anya $500 eyepiece would be a waste of money. Tried contacts while playing basketball in HS/college and had to many issues. Finally about a year ago I found I was getting cataracts in my right eye so opted for lens replacements. Went with far-sightedness for a number of reasons plus did not get astigmatism correction ($$$ and advise from a Ph.D friend), so I still need glasses if I want perfect correction, but for day to day its great anyway. So for me the expensive eyepieces are not justified price wise. I would be paying too much for too little. YRMV. My gut feeling is Al would not have brought out some of the really expensive eyepieces he has except that others have brought out some less expensive ones that come close to his at a much cheaper price point so he had to respond. Which means they had to be even more expensive than the ones he already had out to surpass them in performance. And while he has cut costs by going to Taiwan, which today is not a quality issue, who knows how much they really cost to make. The only way to decide is look thru them. I would never buy an eyepiece based on hearsay. I would check out my friends and a couple of star parties to see if I could find one to look thru. And for what its worth Al's eyepieces are optimized for scopes in the F5-F8 range from my knowledge..",0
"I my opinion the answer is no, Televue EPs are not overpriced, nor are they any where close to being underpriced.. But TV commands the pinnacle of the EP market (available to amateurs).. Here, one gets a well designed, brilliantly executed, nicely packaged EP, with great coatings, at a premium price.. The only EPs, in my collection that are not TV are EPs that TV has no comparable product.. You may cry at the cost of buying one, but when you first use it you know you will never cry again..",0
"As you can see from my sig line I own all of the 68° and 82° ES eyepieces. During the Televue sale I got two Delos in a trade in of my ES152 refractor. I liked them so much that I bought 3 more during the sale. If they had not been on sail them I wouldn't have bought them, too expensive for my taste. They are great eyepieces but my ES 68° eyepieces hold their own against the Delos. The Delos have a ""Port Hole"" experience that I really like. Their ER is very good also. These are the first and only TV eyepieces that I have ever owned. The ES eyepieces get within 5% to 10% of the quality of view of the TV eyepieces. With my eyesight and scopes I can't see paying the extra $$$ for the TV eyepieces but that's just me. If you want top of the line, premium equipment, then you will have to pay the price. Al Nagler deserves every penny of what he earns from the sale of his eyepieces. He didn't get into business to make a ""little"" income!!.",0

"Well I am now a little over five years in this hobby. My first set of eyepieces was Meade QX's. At a star party I had the pleasure of trying a few different 13-14mm eyepieces trying to find one for a gap in what I owned and blind testing the Nagler 13mm was the best hands down. The Nagler over time proved to be so much better than my Meade's I bought a Nagler 9 but at a star party I tried a Pentax 10, so Nagler 9 by-by hello Mr. Pentax. I bought all the eyepieces that are now in my case one at a time and the QX's have been given to a friend. Each has earned it's place in my case, check my signature. By the way TeleVue's are by no means the most expensive check Leica or Nikon.. I am a nob compared to many on this forum and do not profess to be an expert. The Televue's I own out performed for me the others that they were compared to.. Bruce.",0
"OP. nope. tried pretty much everything out there. I would people save up and get some TV Eps. Once a brand come out with a EPs as good or better than TV and Cheaper then i would say TV are overpriced. however on the martket right now there actually reasonable priced for high end performance. personally i think some other EPs are way over priced vs what they can do. dont get me wrong there are some gems out there that aren't TV. But i highly recommend the TV Delos Eps for DSO and if you like a bit wider Ethos. only thing lacking IMHO from TV is a high end planetary EP. yes the TZ zoom is nice but not a TMB SMC or ZAO or Pentax SMC or CZJ etc. still love it just wish they put out a ortho set say under 8mm plossl say a. 7,6,5,4mm high end planetary orthos.",0
If you Google hard enough you'll find that blind tests HAVE been done over the years. From memory the results were in favour of Tele Vue most of the time but there were a significant number of times where that wasn't the case. It just goes to show that everyone is different and we really need to decide for ourselves..,0
"Thanks, I guess I didn't google hard enough. I found this comparison test.. http://www.brayebroo... vs Brandon.pdf. Interestingly and relevent to this thread is the author's conclusion, who said: ""However by far the best value is the GSO Plössl. It consistently outperformed or rivalled the TV Plössl at roughly half the price, even. less if bought cased via Amazon. Not only does the GSO Plössl represent the best value, it ranks overall a better planetary eyepiecethan the TV Plössl, exceeded only by the Brandon which costs almost ten times more."".",0
Good example..,0
"I like the idea that some others have put forward: there's a difference between expensive and over priced. Expensive things cost a lot. Over priced things cost more money than the benefit they give. Something can be expensive without being over priced. To me, the Tele Vue eye pieces I have are not over priced. The Tele Vue eye pieces I don't have I don't believe to be overpriced, I just don't have a use for them for the scopes I have and the observing I do.. So, the Tele Vue eye pieces I have:. I like the longish Naglers for the wide field when looking at extended objects. As I said, I don't have the really long focal length Naglers (26mm and 31mm) because I have other long focal length eye pieces that work well for me.. I don't have any Panoptics because I have Naglers, so I don't feel the need for 68 degree eye pieces.. I like the Radians for their eye relief and short focal length. When I use high magnification I don't look at big objects, so a wide field really isn't necessary.. I like the Plossls for minimal glass when observing the moon, planets and double stars, which is what I do with my driveway scope. Deep sky is unsatisfying from my house. I think I need a second 21mm smoothie Plossl, because it's my favorite galaxy eye piece.. Sure, there are other eye pieces that are more expensive than Tele Vue: Nikon, Docter, Takahashi, Zeiss, TMB monocentric, Clave, etc. I've been fortunate to look through a few and they are really good. I think those that I've looked through are over priced, so I don't own any. Thank goodness for those companies that others appreciate the difference enough to pay for it.",0
"Are the Nordstrom Pet Rocks worth it compared to the regular pet rocks? I think I can answer with some confidence that no, they aren't. The pet rock was a cheap, funny present in the 70s. Now it's a worn out joke, and charging $85 dollars doesn't make it funny. A $10-$15 Vite/Svbony 23mm or 10mm is a cheap, semi-gag gift that's actually worth something.. And Televue? They really took off with the advent of the Nagler and the Dob revolution. The Dob tended to be a cheap design, bringing large aperture and phenomenal savings to their owners. People then blew all their money on expensive eyepieces.. Like jallbery, I have favored medium to long focal lengths, and I prefer tracking when doing some serious viewing. Unlike jallbery, I have owned some Televue equipment, and looked through others. The Televue stuff I own, I no longer use. Frankly, much of it wasn't that good (early Barlows, a Nagler 9mm, a Panoptic 27mm, a Plössl 32mm smoothie from the 80s). Other items, like the Big Barlow, were very good, but in the end not practical for the scopes I use. The stuff Televue excels at, the handling of fast f-ratios, and very wide fields, are things that I don't place a premium on.. Are they overpriced? Again, much of what the competition offers, I'm not that interested in. My favorite implementation of a 100° eyepiece is sold by Lunt. The optics are good, but I saw it in an f8 scope, which is not fast. I mainly like it because of the ergonomics. My experience with Explore Scientific is likewise limited, but I have seen poor light control in their 3x Barlow, and I don't like the ergonomics of their 100° eyepieces.. I tend to like the ergonomics of my eyepieces, and the ones I have kept are modest, but very good performers, with a couple of more expensive exceptions, also very good performers..",0

"It certainly seems that way, especially if you, (like myself) only get out a handful of times a year to view. However, to ardent amateur, who manages to get out very often, putting, 10-20K into the hobby, might not be quite as as economically excessive as it first sounds, compared to other hobbies, like hunting, fishing, boating, motorcycles, snowmobiles, etc....  Now, as I and others have said here in other posts, you do not have to, nor should you feel obligated to spend NEARLY that much money in order to have a great and fun time in the hobby over the course of an entire life time. But I do think we give the hobby a bad rap when we look at AP's , TV's, Tak's,The BIG aperture Dobs and CATs, and the like as excessively expensive, and do not take into account the amount that they get used. It is all a valid part of the calculation each buyer needs to consider.  It is why I will likely putter along doing unguided imaging and video with my perfectly excellent Atlas mount until I retire and can make more consistent use of a nice AP or similar mount:-) Maybe I might even consider one of those really Big Ole Dobs that some of you all favor;-) Ya gotta have Dreams, baby!.

"There are a lot of people who continue to plunk down their hard-earned money to buy Tele Vue eyepieces because they appreciate what they offer the eye(s). These are tools to be used; not centerpieces intended for dining room tables. These forums are rife with the testimony of many who voted with their wallet and believed that the prices they paid, which are more often than not that ""mega"" high, were well worth the trip to the heavens. From my perspective, they're bargains, and I cannot see myself ever wasting time again with tools that do not measure up to standards set by Tele Vue..

"One thing people sometimes forget is that Tele Vue has been a pioneer of many eyepiece designs and that, IMO, is worth a premium. They also boast 100% quality control and, as Matt (Kunama) says, they offer multiple lines covering different designs & features..

"It's probably worth remembering the story behind the TeleVue Plossls, some history can be instructive. Today we think of TeleVue as the manufacturer of exceptional wide field eyepieces and Al Nagler as the man who revolutionized the wide field eyepiece but in 1980, that was not the case.. Al Nagler had been the chief optical designer for a small firm and had designed the optics for the lunar landing simulators that the astronauts used for training before lunar landings. These were essentially huge eyepieces with many elements and a wide field of view. Al Nagler started a new career in the mid 70s, he started TeleVue. TeleVue's first products were not eyepieces but lenses for the projection televisions of the time. But Al had been a life long amateur astronomer, had won awards at Stellarfane as high schooler and maintained his interest.. And he had an idea. Al Nagler knew how design an eyepiece that offered an 82 degree eyepiece that was nearly perfectly corrected for off-axis astigmatism even in a fast scope. This eyepiece was designed and built and it performed as expected. It was the first ""Nagler."". But Al and family was concerned. TeleVue was an unknown company and the Nagler eyepiece was so revolutionary, so much better than anything available, that he felt that he needed to establish TeleVue as a reputable manufacturer before releasing the Nagler simply because no one would believe that such an eyepiece was possible.. And so, Al redesigned the Plossl so that it was better corrected in a fast scope and set about producing and selling TeleVue Plossls. Soon enough, the TeleVue Plossls established TeleVue as manufacturer of quality optics, the first Naglers were released and the rest is history.. Two things stand out:. First, if the TeleVue Plossls had not been well received, if they had not stood out above the rest, they wouldn't have provided the reputation that was needed to pave the way for the Naglers, the Panoptics and all the rest.. Second, TeleVue Plossls are oddballs in the TeleVue line up. They were not an innovative, wide field design, they were not revolutionary, they were a relatively small improvement on what existed at the time.. When comparing TeleVue eyepieces to the others, one really needs to look at the eyepieces that have changed the eyepiece world, the Naglers, the Panoptics, the Ethos's and such.. To read more about the history of TeleVue, Company 7 has a nice page.. Jon.",0
"Ok, I must quote you as being a ""visual only observer""...I love it.. I looked through an ethos over the summer, I'm still drooling.",0
"From an optical performance perspective, most of the TV eyepieces perform to a very high standard. There are other brands that perform to such high standards as well, so TV is not the only one. And by some criteria, others perform better (note that no eyepiece performs best in all optical and viewing criteria). So like some other brandings, they are a top shelf product.. As far as why they cost how much they do, no one but Tele Vue can really answer that. So no one can say it is because they are just charging more, or their cost to develop is more, or their cost to QC is more, or their overhead is high, or their source material vendors charge more, etc. But TVs are not the most expensive either, so a 17 Ethos goes for about $730 whereas a 17mm Nikon NAV HW, also a 100 degree extremely highly corrected eyepiece, goes for about $1,400, and a 7mm Tak UW (90 deg) goes for $630, whereas the WO XWA 101 deg line only goes for about $289 each. Now I am sure all these brandings have different contracts in place for their supplies and different companies are making the optics, and what the exact costs each of these brandings pay for those contract may very well all be completely different and guiding their final costs. So it is never an apples to apples comparison between companies as to what their materials costs are, and these differences can drive the prices quite a bit.. So given all this, there is no real way to answer if they are worth the price. And since that question is highly subjective and would be answered differently by people in differing economic circumstances, makes even more of an unanswerable question..",0
"Yes, they are worth the price--for me. They may not be worth the price for you. Top tier optics are worth me spending the money on them. I am in a position in life where I can afford them. When I was a youngster, I could only afford the basic, least expensive astronomy items. That pretty held through my college years, and early years of marriage, and until my children were educated, married and on their own. Premium optics on eyepieces and telescopes do not give me any more joy in the hobby. Once in 50 nights of viewing, when the seeing is excellent, they do provide a tad more detail in the objects. In that sense, premimum optics do give me more satisfaction. But, those times are very rare.",0
I will say this in my opinion Televue was worth the price until ES started selling 82 degree fov ep's.My eyes don't see a difference so I'm going with ES every time.,0
"Wow, judging by the post count on this thread today (and a few others) we must be close to full moon.. Overpriced involves economics and values. Always dependent upon individual circumstance.. Bill has it pretty close to right - a high standard. High, but not the highest. Perhaps a better word would be a consistent standard and experience. Tele Vue shines in this regard.. Tele Vue also has the lead in innovation, no doubt. We're lucky there is a company that is so interested in a niche so small as amateur astronomy.. On the other hand conventional eyepieces are at an evolutionary dead-end. Does it make sense to invest thousands of dollars in eyepieces that are only marginally better than those of 30 years ago?. If you want to talk about about truly revolutionary deep sky performance there is only one answer. A night vision monocular (which cost less than a collection of Ethos) will show you far more sky.

"This might be a test for ""overpriced"". Imagine you had, let's say, $10,000 you can only spend on eyepieces (and no inclination to become a vendor). Would TV eyepieces seem overpriced to you?. I think of them as expensive, but often worth the cost. The ones I think are not worth the cost - to me only and not to generalize - don't meet my criteria for field of view for a particular focal length, or are zooms, or are older designs..",0
"Supply, demand and market competition. There are basic costs for design, manufacture, distribution and so on built in. After that it's what the market dictates. What exactly their average profit per eyepiece is, we can be sure that Al won't tell us..",0
"When I was 26,, TV over the counter were priced very fine.. Now at 57 my eyes are no what they were ,I was also richer when I was 27. now I can't tell the difference between a prime TV Ethos & A brand X EP that gives me 90% Of the TV's ability's.

"Very, very true! A long time ago I was in an astronomy club, and the observer I respected the most was a quiet guy who always came out with his 4.5 inch Tasco reflector. He used the eyepieces that came with it (a 4mm and 20mm Huygens, I believe), and he would contentedly observe for hours on end. He would occasionally look through someone else's scope when invited, but he never lamented his views. He did wind up upgrading to a couple of TV Plössls and eventually did get a 10"" Dob. But, while he used the Tasco, he was happy. I think he did it the right way - he enjoyed the equipment he had, and when he was ready, he upgraded to better equipment. He never displayed angst or worry that what he had was inferior. I very much respect him.",0
"Looking at the high end of TV,. all the mind-numbing meniscus grinding and fitting together. seem to make perfect sense. Similarly complex camera lenses have. similar pricing.. The TV Plossl is nowhere near that complexity,. but the price is not very high for a specialty 'high grade' unit.. Interesting to see the TV Plossl was made for short barrels.. A design for more afov in longer barrels is easily done, too.. And...a narrow/precise Plossl.. Maybe TV should make the adjustable-spacing Plossl....!. ""------------------------------------------. On the other hand conventional eyepieces are at an evolutionary dead-end.. --------------------------------------------"". I used to think so, but at the lower-cost end, I believe.  the cost concerns that drove the 19th-20th-century designs.  (erfle, plossl, konig, kellner, ortho, RKE, etc).  really need revisiting.  Greater things are possible at the.  low-cost range. (to my surprise, they can be made at home).. There are fantastic EPS between $40 and $100, of course...that's fairly new.. Electronic eyepieces have a ways to go in terms of details and especially contrast range.. The Nagler-related eyepieces have blown past the eye's capabilities,.  so any improvement from there would make no real difference.. I still don't own TV...my position is that my local sky 99% of the time doesn't deserve them,.  and my eyes can't gobble up their scenery.. But I do respect TV, and compared to snazzy high-end audio equipment or cars,.  optical Nirvana is not that far to reach. What's $400 for an EP next to $25,000 for speakers?.",0
"That's not entirely fair. Just like expensive and inexpensive eye pieces (or scopes, or mounts), there are expensive and inexpensive speakers (and amplifiers, and source components).. Astronomy and audio are just like almost any other hobby: you can spend as much or as little as you want. Somebody somewhere makes uber-expensive gear for almost any pursuit..",0
"As with the myriad of other battery-powered astro devices, the answer is ""spares"". Does anyone leave home without them?.",0
"Personally, I see a big difference among the series : comfort, cause of the ER.. If you compare ES 82° with Nagler, I understand, and I find too that the ES's offer more clearness than the Nagler's, with short ER for each, although some Nager's give a very short ER.. But between an ES 82° and a Delos 72°, differences are big, and I prefer this last one for the comfort, the correction, and the different visual effect..",0
"If you mean the overall system...I understand: the sky' the limit for scope + mount + EPs.. I was just making the point that the TV eyepieces are nowhere near as relatively expensive as other components.. EPs might go for $10 to $900.   Stereo speakers might be $25 to $25,000. Telescopes... $100 ----- $25,000 and up and up.... If I wanted to 'spend as much as I want', is there an outfit that makes passive eyepieces for well over $1000?.",0
"This is very true. I get the same emotional reaction when I use a rotary phone, a paper map to navigate in the car, drive a car with a conventional mechanical carburetor and hand crank windows, use a B&W television, listen to vinyl records on a turntable, and listen to a crystal radio..",0
"In a word ""no"".. If you buy them used, you can recoup your purchase price. If you buy them new and wait long enough, you can recoup your purchase price. I was hooked on TeleVue after purchasing a Nagler 7mm T1 in 2004, twelve years later there are ten TV eyepieces in my case as well as a host of other accessories. I have and have used many other eyepieces and like them as well. I view this as a hobby and not a competition. I am glad that there are a lot of choices, and as a previous poster stated TeleVue eyepieces may be expensive, but not over priced.. CS. Jonathan.",0

"It all depends on your observing habits.

It is just nice to be able to set up in 5 minutes and hit the moon, planets and a couple of Messiers with my kids before bed and I find that I am at the point in my life when that situation makes of the bulk of my observing.

"I am a big fan of NV observing, but I also still like conventional observing just because I couldn't afford a WP device, andI don't always want to see green globulars. Given that I still like conventional observing, when I decided to increase my minimalistic eyepiece set from just a 31mm Nagler and a Leica zoom, I added a Paracorr II and a troika of TeleVue Ethe (Ethoses?), so I obviously do not believe that TV eyepieces are overpriced. Of course, the 20% off sale helped..",0
"""Of course, the 20% off sale helped."". I think this made a lot of NEW TV customers! Did they think TV was overpriced before the sale???. Mike.",0
"Are TeleVue's worth it? Hmm, interesting question. I have the follow TeleVue's: 22mm T4 Nagler (LOVE it); 26mm T5 Nagler (LOVE it); 27mm Panoptic (Love it cause my daughter got it for me one Christmas when she was a teen, a real sacrifice and I like the view); 35mm Panoptic (love it, enjoy it); 17.3 Delos (Enjoy It); 12mm, 10mm, 8mm Delos (LOVE them); Type II Paracorr (LOVE LOVE it). So are the worth it to me? Yes. I have the Pentax XW line (3.5mm to 20mm) and I LOVE, LOVE them and use them more in the higher power end. I have some orthos that I really like also. These are worth it to me also.. However, I can remember when I had an Orion XT8, with first, Orion Plossls and then Orion Stratus and Baader Hyperion eyepieces, and though they don't compete with the TeleVue and Pentax it didn't matter. I was out every night I could learning, using and growing. See, for me, everyone wants to brag about premium equipment, and yes, I own premium and premium makes it easier to do visual observing. Is it necessary? No. The most important factor in this hobby to me and in life, is instead of being passive about it, we are actively engaged in it, using the tools we have. I dare say some with a Zhumell 10"" or Orion XT10 or XT8 or Z8 who uses it as often as they can, say four to eight times a month, they learn more than someone with a Star Structure 16"" or StarMaster 14"" dob with all TeleVue eyepieces who only use their equipment several times a year.. So if you don't have TeleVue eyepieces, don't have Pentax, Nikon or other premium eyepieces, that is absolutely fine. Want them? Save and pay cash (that is what I have done over the years). Scopes will change for most in the hobby but premium eyepieces last from scope to scope. However, if you don't have them, you can still enjoy the hobby and get a thrill at seeing Orion's Nebula, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Helix Nebula, the Swan Nebula, the Veil Nebula with other eyepieces also. Get to a dark sky often, use what you have often, and then save up if you want a TeleVue eyepiece. That is perhaps a return question. What TeleVue eyepiece are you thinking of, what scope do you have and why do you want that eyepiece?.",0
"Over the 25years or so that I have been in this hobbyI have owned a lot of TV eyepieces, including all of the Pans and all of the Naglers. I can't speak for the others, but I was not a new TV customer, and I never thought that they were overpriced. I may have had to save a long time for some of them but I gladly handed over my money for them..",0
"I often hear this argument, but do not buy it as the analogy that is implied is off-base. When using NV or an e-EP, you are still out in the environment and very much performing the act of observing, so completly different from sitting at the desk in the house on the internet. So the experience is really exactly the same when using these devices or a conventional old-school glass eyepiece, just the equipment being used is more capable in some respects.. People usually then fall back to the argument about the original photon from the target actually hitting their eyes. Well this is just a psychological over-dramatization over which they have become convinced. Humans cannot ""feel"" original photons vs transmuted ones. So it is entirely a psychological dramatization and not real. And what is actually happening anyway is that the photon is being focussed onto the retina, and then just like in a NV device or e-EP device, that photon is being transmuted to an electrical signal and then modified through numerous protocols (e.g., software or the human perception system), then then reassembled into an image in the brain that is then forwarded to the consciousness. So hardly has that original photon made it to you conscious sight, instead it got squashed by the retina just like it gets squashed by the receptor cell in the NV or e-EP device.. So the bottom line IMO is that if anyone has a sufficiently overactive imagination to think they are ""feeling"" and ""experiencing"" the original light from some far-off target and not realizing that it is just an emotional artifact of their psychology based on their imagination, then they should certainly accept that others have similar over-active imaginations that allows them to feel that when one looks at an image via NV or an e-EP or even on the internet that they are experiencing the real object as well..",0
"Not so. I encountered Dobsonians on the streets of San Francisco in 1979. In 1969, a 24"" Dobsonian made its first appearance at Riverside. Televue released the 13mm Nagler in 1980. I have no doubt that its arrival helped commercial Dob sales.. ​. ​You are probably confusing the release of the Coulter 13.1"" with the larger history of the Dobsonian..",0

"Easy question to answer - ""No"". TV eyepiece's are not overpriced..",0
"Are Televue's overpriced?. Me I don't think they are. I think they are priced in relationship to their quality. I've used several brand of eyepieces and my ""final"" set consists of ES 100 and Televue Naglers. The reason I settled on this set was related to the view, comfort, cost and quality. The Ethos and ES were so close that I couldn't see a premiun for the Ethos, the Naglers were what I purchased when I went to 82* field of view. The ES 82* were not available at the time.. This is not to say all Televue lines are the same, I've never been impressed with the Radians or the Panoptics.. As to the question whether Televue's eyepieces are worth it only you can answer that. As I'm more an imager than visual, if doing it again, I highly doubt I would get TV eyepieces, but thats me..",0
"What i'd like to see is a truly unbiased test involving the following eyepieces on different telescopes (Some i'd hypothesize are negligible differences but others may be easier to disseminate). Eyepieces for ""Blind"" Shootout:. Telescopes (because not everyone has an f/5 reflector ). Skies (Certainly this makes a difference-Some skies brightness differences would again be negligible. But...""Unbiased"" is a difficult thing to do. Even if you wrapped each eyepiece with paper so you could not tell what you were looking through maybe. But... I think it would be an amazing shootout.We are all biased. We all like what we like. Some of us are happy with what we use...maybe just maybe ignorance is bliss. I'm considering a 14mm Explore Scientific 100 Degree for my C8 as a purchase for 2017. 14mm is a highly used focal length in a C8 which is why im spending a little more than normal for this focal length. I've looked through a Ethos don't get me wrong, but how much is it better than the ES100?

Buying used with the internet in todays market can sure stretch a monetary unit, I try to steer clear of the disposable income and value declarations as much as possible as IMO that is a huge variable.

Just check out the Mallincam User group:-) The opening up of the heavens to people who are stirred by that mode of observation is a great thing, to be celebrated! But the the experience of visual observing for many people, including myself, absolutely has psychological, emotional, and spiritual components to it that add to the enjoyment of the experience. Enough so that I doubt the demise of the use of Eyepieces is going to occur any time soon, and why there is a continued demand for the TV product lines, in spite of their universally recognized cost(note the valiant attempt to come back to the original topic:-). The experience is DIFFERENT for me. Not necessarily better or worse, but DIFFERENT and I enjoy it for what it is. I like bacon a lot, but I also enjoy sausage with my eggs in the morning. It is a great day when I can have them both!:-). With respect to characterization of observers as having over active imaginations, I give the poster credit for being even handed in his applying this characterization to proponents of both methods of observation. My only comment to that would be, if gazing at the heavens (through whatever means) does not fire the imagination and stir the soul, then why look at all.. Cheers!. JMD.",0
"That doesn’t matter.. The emotional/intellectual/visceral impact of what is seen is the same.. I’ve let out an audible WOW! when looking through an eyepiece, looking at the view on a monitor from an astro video camera, or looking through my night vision eyepiece.. There is absolutely no emotional difference. However there is one difference. You can see more detail with a Night Vision eyepiece than with a regular eyepiece.. Bob.",0
"This question comes up from time to time and it usually indicates an unfamiliarity with the market.. First, they aren't the most expensive. Leica, Nikon, Docter, Takahashi, and even Explore Scientific, make more expensive eyepieces.. Second, they aren't expensive if you choose narrower fields of view. TeleVue Plossls are fairly inexpensive eyepieces. They just get expensive as the apparent fields get larger.. That happens with almost any brand.. Third, they aren't expensive if you just add inflation to the prices of eyepieces in 1980. With only inflation added, Plossls from that era would cost more than TeleVue Naglers today,. yet the Naglers have substantially wider fields, more lenses, and superior coatings to those older eyepieces.. Fourth, and here is a good point, sometimes doubling the production time only adds a few percent to the quality. If each lens is polished for twice as long, production is halved. and the cost of production goes way up, yet the lens may only be a few percent (if that) better. In the same way a $400,000 Lamborghini may only be slightly better than a $125,000 Audi,. sometimes small volume and high quality control can double or triple a price while only making something a bit better.. Fifth, it may not be fair to compare eyepieces from a company selling direct to consumers with a company that sells to retailers and pays for importation. Adding an extra layer of supply chain. will increase prices.. Sixth, TeleVue offers inspection and repair for old products and direct phone-line conversations with amateurs that call. Their customer service is second to none in the industry.. Seventh, Tele Vue is tops in the design field. Their eyepieces worth with shorter f/ratios without inducing aberrations (compared to others), and have less in the way of inherent aberrations than others.. Eighth, their quality control is exceptional. Issues of debris in the eyepieces, bubbles in the glass, or assembly errors are virtually non-existent.. Every eyepiece is inspected before shipment. Even if a company in Taiwan wants to buy a Taiwan-made eyepiece, it is first inspected in New York, then goes back to Taiwan.. Ninth, They have more inventory in stock more of the time than any of their competitors.. Tenth, they offer more selection than any other company. At last count, 49 different eyepieces. No one else offers that selection.. So are they overpriced?. NO.. IMHO, of course..",0
"Best not show noobies the view with assisted astronomy , when they get a scope they'll be underwhelmed just like some are after they've seen Hubble images..",0

"Speaking of which, and going slight off topic, I see the Atik Infinity has shot up in price, again, to £929..........so I'm definitely underwhelmed on the rises which makes them, in my opinion, over priced............unlike Televue's",0
"No. They're not overpriced. I've been buying & using TeleVue eyepieces since Al Nagler founded the company, and I've remained a happy camper ever since.

"I own three TV plossls; the 8, 11, and 15mm.  I also own the TV 3x Barlow.. Concerning the EPs; I believe they are overpriced.  Of course my opinion formed by comparison with other plossls. I have several other plossl lines that are very close if not equal to or better then the TVs. They all cost 1/2 less the price of the TV plossl line if not more.  My main contention with the TVs is their tight eyerelief and limited FOV.  However the views are generally great within the FOV.  Their constructive is also first rate.. The 3x Barlow is a world beater.  It's an extremely good barlow and worth its cost. I do not own other TV occulars, so I'm not comfortable in commenting.",0

That there is anything under $100 is simply incredible, and we owe it to Chinese manufacturing.. Are they overpriced compared to other Japanese eyepieces? Or are they overpriced comparing them to Chinese eyepieces?. The source will make a difference..",0
Any way you tell it the Tele Vue are good if pricy eyepieces. But if you get what you want out of one then it is worth it to you. I would say they are costly but very good eyepieces. Especially from 82 FOV and up. I have a Panoptic 27 mm and I am about to get the Panoptic 35mm. Just as a contrast I am also getting a GSO 42mm. Expensive yes but if they are the eyepiece that changes how you view Astronomy? They they are worth whatever you can afford for them. So it is a matter of preference and your ability to purchase them..,0
"If I consider my level of disposable income, the amount of money I'm willing to have invested in any hobby, and the fact that I came away rather underwhelmed after comparing a couple TV eyepieces to less expensive options, the answer is an easy YES. But it's a question of strictly personal opinion..",0
"Yep. Sky & Telescope had the first mentions of them in July 1970 issue. Which of course means they were being built earlier..

"Clipped for length, but extremely well reasoned.. I currently only own two Tele Vue eyepieces - 22 and 27 Panoptics. Not even current designs..

(And the increase in performance would be quite marginal.). It's hard to see why people can't wrap their minds around the concept of ""you get what you pay for""..",0
"Is that really true for you? Do you really get emotional using hand crank windows? I prefer hand crank windows because they are more reliable and easier to repair but I don't find the experience of operating a car with hand crank windows much different from driving a car with electric windows. I open the windows, the wind comes in just about the same either way.. Our motor home has a carburettor, my emotional response to driving the motor has very little to do with the factor that it has a carburettor. It drives just fine and I look out the window and enjoy the sights. The fond memories of the times spent in the wilds of the southwest are probably the predominate emotion.. I realize that a rotary phone probably is clearer than most cell phones but the experience is essentially the same, they are active devices that uses a microphone to translate the audio waves into electrical signals which are then transmitted and at the far end, the electrical signals are translated back into audio waves using a speaker.. A telescope eyepiece is quite different from an electronic image enhancer. An eyepiece a passive device that serves to focus the image at the focal plane to bring the eye closer to the focal plane of the telescope. The color of the light, the relative intensities, the contrast, these only slightly affected.. E.A.A. is quite different, it is much more like the telephone. There are eyepieces that are based on image intensifier technology, you lose color with such eyepieces. But most translate the image into electronic signals, process and ""enhance"" those signals and the translate them back light using screen of some sort. That translation and reproduction is an approximation, some better, some not so good.. The end result is that the actual image, while some aspects are greatly enhanced, some are not so accurately reproduced, is quite different from one sees with an eyepiece.. People still fly fish, they still go out there with a rod and reel and cast jigs and lures, use live bait, it's just part of the fun of life.. But you catch a lot more fish with a gill net or a purse seine... ==============================================.

The 35mm Panoptic, the 31mm Nagtler in Uncle Al's best 4 inch F/5.4, a cool, calm summer evening, the sky is dark and clear, just looking around, I can't beat that.

"Stuff is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Marketing or not, folks buy them, and they are still in business.

I'm sure they are worth the money, just not my money at this point in the game. I'd rather drop a few grand on a Tremec TKO for my Chevelle. Maybe some day though, who knows. Economics; trying to satisfy unlimited wants with limited means..",0
"It's true that sometimes you can pay a lot for something that is substandard but in the eyepiece market, you pretty much get what you pay for.. My own thinking is that TeleVue eyepieces are well made priced accordingly. No one is getting rich from ungodly profits made by manufacturing and marketing TeleVue eyepieces. For what they are, TeleVue eyepieces are reasonably priced, they are not overpriced, they are not underpriced.. Whether one wants to spend that much on an eyepiece, that's a personal decision and as Jeff said, you get what you pay for. Myself, I am cheap by nature. Used cars, second hand furniture, clothes at Walmart. But, I spend about 150-200 nights per year out under the stars and I want some decent quality equipment. Investing in TeleVue eyepieces is a luxury but compared to many hobbies, it's a drop in the bucket.. $600 for an eyepiece.. For a friend that is into deep sea fishing, that's the fuel cost for a day.... Of course they split it two ways so it's only $300. Per day. And that's just the fuel, not the upkeep and repair. You go fishing, you toss a Type 6 Nagler over the side.. Jon.",0
The 35 mm pan in the TV102 is not to shabby either! I am with you on that! Uncle Al's stuff works well together. Makes you think he might have planned it that way;-). JMD.,0
This is an easy question to answer having been exactly in the position you suggest with my son. Absolutely and unequivocally would choose electronic as this is more detailed and precise and life saving. The only reason he is still alive. Exploratory surgery is gross in what it can do without the aid of electronic imaging both prior and during the execution of the followup corrective surgery. The corrective surgery for many things would be impossible to conduct without the use of electronic real-time imaging to guide the knife.. You guys continue to have fun theorizing on this topic... certainly no foul but this analogy this one hit too close to home for me to continue as brought back too many difficult memories. Sorry..,0

"Hi:. I know that the price of a product is established by,  ""whatever the market will bare"".   At least that what I was taught years ago during an accounting class.  Thus a company will charge as much as possible for a product.  IE, if the public will pay the price, you would have toothpicks that cost $100 each.   U can make the argument if we are willing to pay a specific price, then it's not over priced.   However, using that logic nothing would be over priced.  That's why I noted my belief that there are several lines of plossls which performed as well as TV plossls but were a available at 1/2 the price or even less.  By that standard I believe TV plossls are overpriced. On the other hand I believe the TV 3x Barlow to be a superior barlow and easily worth its price of about $110.",0
"Are they overpriced? This my perspective only:. In the focal lengths I use a lot I will say NO. They are worth every penny. Including that monstrosity the 21E with its eye watering, nose stinging price. For me, the incremental improvement in view quality adds up with lots of use*. Ditto the Delos and NT6s. The cost/benefit was crossed a long time ago. It's all good times from here!. In the 30mm FL that acts mostly as a finder EP and has limited gawk time and only 1 favourite view, my determination is YES. I have an ES30 secondhand. At less than 1/4 cost of a new 31T5 + my preference for shorter focal lengths, this is where I'm staying.. One other point: innovation. I'm no EP historian so I could be very wrong here, but it seems to me that TV leads the way more than it follows. I'd hate to think things became stagnant just because we all chose clones.. * This is going on perceived image quality vs a properly functioning ES20-100. ** Add in the risk of no domestic after sales support for the ES, plus observed variable QC and the question becomes moot. This point would be of less concern to someone with recourse to after sales care..",0
"In other words, for those who want these eyepieces and buy them, they are not overpriced. But for those who want them and don't buy them, they are overpriced.. As far as pricing ""what the market will bear"", sorry, that's pretty meaningless. Do I beke a better profit is I sell 10 eyepieces amd make a hundred dollars on each, or do I make more profit if I sell a thousand eyepieces and make $10 on each? I'll leave it to you to do the math.. Factors that go into the production of eyepieces (assuming the research has been done and there's a potential market for the product) include the cost of design (more or less fixed cost), general cost of doing business (rent, utilities, staff, property tax, etc.) (again, more or less fixed cost), production cost (with economies of scale, so variable per unit), quality control (probably variable but diminishing over time), marketing (probably variable), profit - then sales to vendors who probably take at least a 25% markup. And that leaves out a ton of detAil.. From the buyer's side, compare the usefulness and perceived quality against the price. Does a 10% improvement warrant a 200% increase in price? See my first sentence....",0
"Apple certainly does great marketing, ever since the 1984 SuperBowl ad for the original Mac.. But if the product didn't have a better user interface and superior user experience, the marketing would have failed in short order, and Apple would be out of business in a year.. Just as IT Experts have been predicting (continuously) since.. 1984.. Looking at Tele Vue - my personal opinion is that their marketing tag lines are rather corny. But, they do deliver a fairly good and uniform user experience (undercuts notwithstanding)..",0
I think that Tele Vue advertising is very factual and educational:. LOL!,0

"There are many eyepiece brandsI would question concerning a true value, (performance/price), but TV is not one of them. One of the prime attributes Al builds into his eyepieces is the ability to perform well with a variety of telescope types and focal ratios. Many of my eyepieces are regulated to one type of telescope, such as a slow refractor where they perform fine. When I switch telescopes I may have to get a different brand out to suit that one, such as a fast dob design. TV eyepieces seem to perform better in a broader range. of styles and focal lengths than any other brand I have encountered. There are exceptions of course but overall this has become my impression. GSO plossls are pretty excellent as noted above, but probably won't hold value as much as the TV eyepieces over time..",0
"Hi:   In effect, your first sentence is correct.   Those who buy a produce and continue to do so are stating for them the product is not overpriced.   For others the cost may exceed their perceived benefit.     I had a professor who said when u bought a product u were in effect voting for that product.  Your money was labeled dollar votes.  That definition I quoted is what I was taught I an economics classs while I was in college.   I remember it well because most people think the price of a product is determined by the old statement, ""supply and demand.""   But I was taught that is simply not true.  All companies charge the highest price for an object that will sell.  Of course a company has to take into consideration return and repeat business.  But any company will do whatever it can within reason to maximize profits.   So for me, TV plossls r overpriced.   I get as much benefit from more economically priced plossls.",0
"In all consumer fields, the gap between price and performance widens as the quality of the product approaches 'perfection'. Televue products follow this trend, so they're not overpriced. Another thing is the quality/price ratio which drops as a consequence of the widening gap between the two (it's simple math).. Moral of the story: people who want the best must be prepared to spend. On the other side, for about half the price of a top-of-the-line product, one can buy something that is far less behind in quality than the simple price difference suggests..",0
"In just the past couple of decades Televue has debuted the Ethos, Delos and Delite lines. I don't know the specifics but I would bet it took a year or more to design, field test and begin production of each of those lines which means that all that R&D work was paid for by the prior sale of Naglers, Panoptics, etc. These things don't spring full-blown from the factory without considerable upfront investment.. Plus, eyepieces are as durable an item as we use in this hobby. The ones in my case (and there are about $10,000 worth there!) will last me the remainder of my lifetime and be passed on to others. It is not inconceivable that some of my eyepieces will still be in use 50 years from now. That makes the up front cost pretty minimal. In fact I don't know of anything with comparable expected longevity in any other hobby..",0
"I find there's always something extra in engineering or quality pushing a TV eyepiece above the crowd.. There are outstanding eyepieces in other brands, but usually it's only found in one particular eyepiece out of a series.. With Televe, the entire line will be excellent..",0
"I think Astro-Physics is an example of a company that does not use that business model. When used scopes sell for more than new ones, there's a message there. But from reading what Roland has written, his goal was to put bring high quality, affordable telescopes to the amateur community and he has done that.. As an engineer rather than a economist, I look at production costs and overhead and my guess is that based on cost and margins, TeleVue Plossls are not overpriced. You can always buy something cheaper that will compromise performance so that is a judgment call. The difference between the Value Plossls and the GSO Plossls is not a lot, it just depends on what you are willing to sacrifice.. I rarely use Plossls so I am happy with my Celestron GSO Halloween Plossls. But I don't think the TV Plossls are overpriced, they just cost more than I am willing to pay.. Jon.",0
"Now that is an interesting case.. With a ten year waiting list, Roland Christen is doing a very poor job in his mission of bringing affordable telescopes to the market. Namely, because he is not bringing very many telescopes to market!. If used prices are as high or higher than new, he still has some room to go in his pricing. Suppose he raised his prices 20%. It would be pure profit which he could use to expand his factory, hire people, increase production, and do a better job at satisfying demand and reducing the wait list.. Clearly RC knows much more about Optics than he does about economics, trade, fair value, or business.. Tele Vue has the opposite problem. They have a low-cost competitor that is using their R&D and producing clones of reasonably close performance for a great deal less money. Tele Vue has zero room to raise capital by increasing price. (And, their subcontractors can produce all of the units the market demands.). Everyone wants the Green label - but they expect it at the cost of the cloners and feel ripped-off by paying the Tele Vue products ""true cost"". Hence threads like these..",0
"Explore1’s simple question seems to have touched a nerve judging from the number of responses for this thread. The question isn’t simply whether Televue is too expensive, but rather how we should spend two of our most precious resources: time and money. Last Friday night I wanted to watch a movie but I didn’t want to waste two hours watching a mediocre move so instead I spent an hour reading various synopsis and reviews before I realized it was too late to watch a movie. Similarly, I’ve probably spent more time reading reviews and forum post to optimize my equipment than actual observation. Like the beefcake who drives takes the elevator to the gym, how many of us ignored the daily subtle and sublimed beauty of light all around us, only to focus on capturing a bit more distortion-free photons from a visually static object a few arc minutes across. We do this because we how we spent our time and money is part of a narrative of who we are and the meaning of our lives..",0
"Dear Lift Off, I agree..",0
"An eyepiece line (pentax XW) quite similar in performance to one of TeleVue's line (Delos) costs about the same (or did when they were still in production). Yet, I have'nt seen too many threads asking if the Pentax XWs were overpriced..",0
"Tele Vue seems to have more ""hits"" and fewer ""misses"" than their competitors. While some of their eyepieces haven't been perfect, like the severe kidney-beaning 13mm T1 Nagler, the low eye relief 4.8mm Nagler (specs say 7mm, most observers say 6mm at best) and the 12mm, 17mm and 22mm Nagler T4's have a completely idiotic eye cup height adjustment scheme. In some respects, I guess you might say they're not afraid to use customers as ""beta testers"". The flip side of that coin is that they do seriously listen to customers so they can avoid making the same mistakes and hopefully improve each new generation of eyepieces. For example, unlike the earlier Nagler T4 line, the eye cup height adjustment in the Delos line works beautifully. Early on, besides their superior coatings, Tele Vue's use of blackened edges on all of the lens elements in each eyepiece made such a visible improvement that it forced the whole industry to respond in kind. I've done serious head-to-head field test comparisons and, while it was sometimes very close, TV eyepieces never lost one of those battles. I was ""wowed"" in 1985 and I'm still ""wowed"" by their current eyepieces today. Optically, we all want perfection but reality is that spending $500 (or more!) on an eyepiece does not guarantee perfection, no matter who makes the eyepiece. There are always going to be compromises. I've had a lot of eyepieces over the years, they come and they go, but my best compliment to the high-dollar value of Tele Vues is that they have almost all been ""keepers"". So, when I buy a Tele Vue eyepiece, I know what to expect...I'm okay if there's a minor compromise or two and I'm always confident that I'll be more than pleased with the the performance...and, at the end of the night, isn't that what counts?. Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with Tele Vue or any astronomy-related manufacturer or distributor..",0
"Agreed. I am still curious whether the Topic Starter, here, will share his or her experiences, if any, with Tele Vues..",0
"I suppose I contributed to some of the controversy by stating I felt the TV plossls were overpriced.  So, for the purpose of clarity and in an attempt to further explain my view:. My comments were about the TV plossls 15, 11, and 8mm as well as the TV 3x Barlow.  I own those occulars.  I thought I made it clear that my comments concerned only those items.  I do not own any other TV eyepieces.   I wrote that I felt the plossls were over priced because some competitive brands provided  views that I felt were very close if not better then the TV plossls.  I made that statement because the TV plossls I own had very tight eyerelief and FOVs. I also wrote that my  comments were subjective, by which I meant was based on my perception.  I also noted the provided views were great just too tight for me.   I also pointed out the TV plossl constructive was first rate.   Since the competitors plossls are 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of the TV plossls I believed the TVs were overpriced.   I didn't consider any other factors but performance,construction and cost compaired to other brand plossl EPs. I also pointed out the TV 3x Barlow was a great buy and a top notch occular, well worth the price.  I don't have any interest in any company either TV or its competitors.  I was just participating in what I felt was a very interesting discussion.   I hope this clears things up a bit.",0
"Maximizing profits does not necessarily mean ""the highest price"" (I'm not sure what you mean by ""that will sell""). What we often find is market segmentation. So you can buy a particular North Face coat for $200 from North Face, or at a 10-20% discount from many dealers, or for $100-$120 at the end of the season from discount merchants, or on Ebay unlabeled for $80 shipped.. Then there is the secondary (used) market.. For astro equipment the discounts are much lower, but the secondary market (which most often supplies products that are good as new) for 50-70% of the new product market..",0
"@ Shneor,. The clothing business runs on margins of 100% to 140% - I would know as I was CFO for a company that sold luxury goods and average labels (clothing, shoes, jewellery, watches).. Nothing comparable to eyepieces where margins are tighter as there is R&D involved and a true cost to the product. The average TV eyepiece has a lot more cost than a Louis Vuitton bag which costs a negligible amount to manufacture, but is charged for a few hundred dollars (the cheapest one) for the privilege of ""prestige"" or whatever.. While a well executed eyepiece can provide better views, a Louis Vuitton bag carries stuff in exactly the same way as another bag. But people pay through their teeth so that someone will open the door for them at the boutique and suck up to them, to make them feel important and also for the ""look at me, look at me"" factor.. @ Lenny,. Plossls by design have low eye relief as you progress to plossls from low to high magnifications. This has nothing to do with TV, it is the design of Plossl eyepieces.. You pay for better quality materials, better manufacturing tolerances, better resale value and yes, a certain ""I own TV eyepieces"" prestige if one ascribes to that. How much that is worth to someone is entirely subjective as you note and I thank you for stating that as people like to apply their experiences globally and declare them to be a gospel.. -------. My 2c on the matter is that without knowing the price structure of TV we cannot be sure if they are charging too much. But from feedback occasionally posted here by reputable vendors, the margins appear to be pretty low.. Even low margins does not mean that the eyepieces are not overpriced. They are overpriced relative to other eyepieces with similar properties in regards to their characteristics (eye relief, focal length, AFOV), but this is a different story performance-wise.. If you feel that they perform better in some regard, then they are not overpriced. If you feel that the difference in performance is not that much to warrant the difference in price, then for whoever considers buying them, they will appear overpriced.. In the end, these eyepieces perform well as indicated by their popularity. But so do other brands. You choose based on what your head, heart and wallet say - depending on who wins..",0
"Plossls are scaled designs with respect to eye relief. Know the focal length and youcan calculate the eye relief across manufacturers. They generally seem to be the same across lines when I have checked, although I have only checked a few. But I guess there is not a single Plossl design, so perhaps you are comparing to a different variant. Plossl eye relief gets short below around 13mm focal length. That is one of the things that made the Naglers such a welcome relief...literally, a very wide field with comfortable eye relief. Even the 7mm T1still had 10mm of eye relief despite also being a scaled design. After using a 9mmT1 I found few reasons to use my 7.4 or 13 Plossls, and soon added a 7mm T1.. As far as price goes, I tend to buy things that I have some confidence in. Bargain Plossl's can be decent and I have some free ones that came with scopes, but they usually are cutting some corners. So when I found I had a needof a 32mm Plossl after all these years, I went back to the well with TV again. I don't discourage folks from buying or using less expensive builds, but I am more hesitant to recommend them because I don't know how picky the user will be or what the build quality will be..",0
"The number of telescopes Astro-Physics produces is limited by Roland's output, not by the cost. It's a different business model and obviously it's been successful in providing high quality telescopes (and mounts) to the amateur community. You could look a little further than just the number of Astro-Physics scopes produced to understand Roland's thinking. He led the way, he showed how to do it and people learned. All those TMB triplets that have been copied, where did TMB spring from? When you look at a ED triplet, think to yourself, ""Roland had something to do with that."". I find his business model refreshing, it shows that an enterprise can be successful if it's priorities are more than just making as much money as possible. Some folks have trouble thinking in those terms. I think he's wiser than you might think. He did his way, he enjoys life and his goal of raising the quality of optics available to the amateur community has been reached. This is a good read, posted in at least 3 forums here on Cloudy Nights in the past day or two:. The Future of Astro-Physics. ""P.S. And for the fellow that asked about a scope since 2007 in the Cloudy night's post above - yes, consider purchasing a scope from the many fine instruments available.

"In 1996 I had a Orange Tube C-8 and three boys in college. There wasn't much money for extras but I wanted to purchase a 32mm Plossl to provide the widest possible field of view for my C-8.. Fortunately, the 1996 issue of Sky and Telescope had a comprehensive test of 31 different Plossls. I read that report carefully and decided to purchase the 32mm Celestron Plossl. It was about half the price of the TeleVue unit and looked to be a very solid eyepiece. I still have that eyepiece, in the past few years, that series has come to be called the ""Halloween Plossls"", it's been a good eyepiece. Amymore, I rarely use it for astronomy but over the years I have used it for Digiscoping, (afocally imaging birds) and taken many thousands of images, it has shown that indeed the original review was on the money, a good solid eyepiece with excellent on-axis sharpness.

I am only comparing th TV plossls to my other brand plossls with a similar lens configuration.  It's my personal opinion.  I am aware of the various trade offs when it comes to eyepieces.   I prefer a little more Eyerelief.   My TV 3x Barlow is great and well worth the money. As far as the posts I made concerning economics and the various definitions, etc.  those are what I was taught and were considered the prevailing belief when I was in college 25 years ago.

For example, if I want the best possible coatings, that costs money.

"Many years ago, when I started in this hobby, long eye relief was only obtainable in long focal length eyepieces, and even some of them were fairly tight..

So there is no shortage of long-eye relief eyepieces unless you want 82° or more of apparent field.. There, there are some, but they are not common.. Other than that, though, we have a LOT of long eye relief choices, and more coming out every day..",0

"I have several TeleVue eyepieces. I bought all of them used. To me, they are a tremendous value. Here are some areas that I've noticed they exceed the competition. Construction/Machining. The body components are made to very tight tolerances, and seem to have very high sample consistency. My 11mm Plossls slide slowly into the eyepiece holders of my binoviewers, and there is no difference depending on which side I put each eyepiece into. I've never had to mess with centering, and they are perfectly parfocal. The only other eyepieces to achieve this are my Fujiyama Orthos. All others require tweaking, recentering, rotating, etc. to merge properly.. Another observation - I committed the heinous sin of modifying my 11mm Plossls to make them more like volcano top eyepieces, to improve eye relief. I tapered the top of the eyepiece body using my lathe. Since this is not a critical operation, I didn't bother with precise centering or truing up - I merely chucked the eyepiece by the barrel. The upper body of the eyepiece on both samples turned true within a few thousandths. This shows very high tolerances in the threading interface between the upper body and barrel. Coatings. In comparing the TV 55 Plossl to the late-model Meade 56 Super Plossl, the TV coatings are far superior. I held both up to a bright light source, and the Meade easily showed internal reflections on the glass. Not even a hint of reflections were seen on the TV.. Internal blackening. In every TV eyepiece I've looked down, it's like peering into a pitch black cave. Their internal blackening/baffling is excellent. Most other eyepieces have a multitude of lighter and somewhat reflective (black anodized) interior surfaces. Even the black paint they use on the barrel its self seems to be much darker and ""blacker"" than what I've seen from other eyepieces.. Overall, my experience shows that TV pays a lot of attention to small details to make their products very high quality. That kind of scrutiny definitely adds to the cost, but can have tangible benefits in critical viewing scenarios..",0
"I've used more Televue stuff now, and had more time with the alternatives. Would I say it's worth the cost? Well, it depends. The cost is significant, and the alternatives are often pretty good. Meade UWAS and ES82s are really good and it's better to have those than to maybe be thinking of getting a Nagler someday, or skimp on the rest of your kit. But if you can afford them, yep, they're better. And you'll be using eyepieces every time you observe, so it's a good thing to put money into.. I think for most people I would still recommend starting out with cheaper eyepieces. Most people will need years to absorb the substantial cost of building a Televue eyepiece collection, and eyepieces resell well, so it's a good idea to get something to use in the meantime. Or maybe they'll be so good you'll never see the need.",0

"I'm on the Yahoo AP group, so I saw the original post. Very appropriate timing, and sheds some light on things. For example, RC is putting procedures in place to turn things over to another optician(s).. And there is a new fast imaging visual scope announcement forthcoming. Depending upon what it is I'll probably get on that list to use with my NV tube, even though I will probably have macular degeneration by the time they deliver.. As to how ""noble"" his business philosophy may be - I make no presumption that profitable growth and success is somehow ""dirty"".. It is surprising (to me anyway) that he chose to invest more in mounts than optics. Mechanical engineering and machinist talent is far more common than the type of talents he has in optical design and fabrication. Perhaps mounts have a higher profit margin.. Better judges of his priorities may be people on that ten year (or whatever it is now) wait list. I suspect most of them want the finest equipment to fulfill their lifetime visual/creative aspirations. Watching the prime of their lives fly by while waiting on the pinnacle of perfection is probably a bitter pill to swallow.. Speaking of which,I suspect once RC completes his Hawaii observatory, he won't be pushing much glass at all. I wonder how those folks on the list will feel about getting a non-RC telescope?.",0
"What happened with the Dobsonian was interesting as it led to a change in and a resurgence of ATMing. Fewer people were grinding their own mirrors in the 1970s, but they began building Dobs and purchasing the mirrors to go inside. The Dob is many things, but scary to work with isn't one of them. That was the market Nagler saw when he developed the Nagler.. Word is that Al delayed the release of the Nagler 13mm from the late 70s to 1980-81 to give his new company some credibility with a line of Plössls first, before venturing out there with an unknown (expensive) design. By delaying a couple of years, he got very lucky. Coulter released the Odyssey 1 in May 1980..",0

The TV fanatics do themselves a disservice by constantly injecting themselves where they are not wanted...I could start a thread with ""looking for some good cheap kellners/huygens, NO TV product/fanboy comments needed"" and they'll definitely be in there spouting ""Ethos"", ""Delos"", ""Nagler"" like every one of them owns major shares and is desperate to keep a failing company float or something..

Type 72 Naglers coming soon....LOL If TV stuff was THAT GOOD they wouldn't have to troll every thread where TV WASN'T being considered. And it's NOT as if ES or any other company couldn't produce an equally corrected EP and charge the same inflated price. YES, they are over priced.

(besides edge correction at extremely short F/L's) I'm a mechanic and I know Snap-on tools aren't necessary...exact same thing, a status symbol.

"I am happy that Tele Vue has some lower-priced competition. I think Tele Vue spurred everyone to raise their standards of quality and performance.. Here's a historical data point. The Zeiss Astro-Plan, a flat-field König derivative (I think), cost $140 in 1971. That is about $900 in today's dollars. And today $200 will buy much better eyepieces, simply because of technical progress..",0
"Hi again:  this is a thread that started with the simple question, ""are TV eyepieces overpriced"". I didn't start the thread, but I wrote that yes, I thought the plossls were overpriced.  I have consistently said it is my opinion they are overpriced and I stated why I felt that way.  I noted the problems with the tight eyerelief and that some competitive brands provided as good a view with a little better FOV and eyerelief.   Plus they are 1/2 to 1/3 the price.  My opinion concerns only their plossls (the 15, 11, and 8mm). and their 3x Barlow because I only own those occulars. I know that a person can buy the TV plossls because they appear to be built better and there is better quality control etc.   But I took all of that into consideration. I still believe they are overpriced when compared to other plossls.  So, I hope that we all keep our heads about this issue.  I can tell that some of you are passionate TV supporters and that's fine by me.  I respect you for your opinion.  Finally, I have read all of the contrary posts and have benefited from the knowledge gained.",0
"I am not a Televue fan boy, but Delos line simply gives to me high optical quality, good ergonomics, large field, and big comfort through large ER, that is exactly what I wished.. That was before the existence of Morpheus line, cheaper and very good, but not adjustable.. Nikon NAV-SW ate more expensive, have not the same ER, but are smaller, that's true.. Anyway, all my Deloses are second hand, but if not, I think that I could have been able to buy them new, on a longer period.. All things considered, if I had to look for good eyepieces, I'd buy Delos again once more, with maybe one or two Pentax XW, I love them too but I wanted a coherent line.. You know what ? I'm happy !",0
"Also, the reason Tele-vue doesn't sell replacement smooth barrels is pretty obvious if you've ever looked closely at their eyepieces. A lot of them (perhaps most) have lenses and other parts within the barrel! So it's not like you could just unscrew the barrel and screw on another one. It would be major surgery to remove and replace the barrel elements, and you could easily get them dirty or get the spacing wrong..",0
"Wow, someone needs a time out. Why don't you tell us how you really feel? Your opinion is as valid as anyone else's but you seem to have a deep seated hate injected into yours as far as TeleVue and other folks opinions are concerned. You don't have to disrespect anyone when stating your opinions and your feelings about the eyepieces others choose to buy. Simply say they are not worth it, to you. Myself, with the premium optics I put in my homemade telescope I choose to use the best I can afford which includes a Paracorr to correct my fast mirror. I bought most of them used and in my opinion they make that rare perfect night out under the stars more perfect.",0
"I think you have to look at the history. The TV Plössls were introduced back in the 1980s and raised the standard. At the time most of us were using Kellners! Several competitors caught up with it very quickly at lower prices. Whether TV Plössls are better than all of the competitors is debatable now -- Plössl is Plössl, and once a certain level of quality is reached, there's not much more to go. TV's forte is the wide-angle and long-eye-relief designs, not Plössls, although their Plössls are certainly very good and I have a couple of them.. So, on the narrow question of whether TV's Plössls are overpriced relative to the competing very similar Plössls available today -- I won't say they are, and I won't say they aren't. I will gladly say that if you want a Plössl, TV is not the only game in town..",0
"If you are happy with your gear, then God bless. Through the vast majority of this thread, most of us who have been affirmative with respect to the OP's question, have been respectful in our responses.  When someone asks the question ""Is brand x worth the price"", why should one be surprised when people step up and say yes?  You could have substituted ES for TV and there would have been a host of people saying yes. Some of them would have been TV owners!  Disagreeing with the idea that TV's or any other EP brand are not worth the price because EAA is going to replace them is not a knock on EAA. Each tool for the right job.  I will summarize what I and many others here have repeatedly said 1. The best gear to use is the gear that gets you outside and under the stars. 2. You should not feel obligated to mortgage the house to enjoy this hobby. It certainly is not necessary and anyone that suggests otherwise is wrong.. 3. Making better optics costs more. Reducing costs means making compromises. 4. The returns in performance diminish as the cost goes up. It is entirely up the individual to determine what works of for them.. 5. See number 1 It is the circle of life and you could substitute any other product in for optics and not diminish the truth of it.. JMD.",0

"I'm not going to get into the other threads at this moment, but I will say that in this thread, people ""spouting 'Ethos,' 'Delos,' 'Nagler,'"" are by definition doing so, because it's appropriate to the thread..",0
"Mr. Nagler is the kindest, gentlest, lovingest and most competent optician/designer of fine eyepieces I know, who provides great value in his product lines for the benefit and pleasure of his exceptional customers. And, why yes, I keep a copy of an autographed picture of Uncle Al in a prominent place on my piano!. Happy holidays, y'all!.",0
"You were aware that the Plossl was invented in 1860, right?.",0
"Yes. And that Clavé Plössls were considered elite eyepieces in the 1970s In those days, though, Kellners were the usual economy eyepieces, and people who wanted a better eyepiece generally used orthoscopics. Plössls existed but were not all that widely used until Tele Vue introduced its line.  Soon Plössls were popular everywhere, and, as I said, other companies were making some that were probably not significantly inferior to Tele Vue's.  Tele Vue's strength is the original designs (Nagler, etc.). Their Plössls are good but not incomparable..",0
Now more than ever I'm so looking forward to getting my first TV eyepiece..,0
"Hope it is all you want it to be.... in reality the differences are far far far far smaller than often stated here,. I have compared Pentax, TV, Vixen, Baader and Tak eyepieces and each had their strengths and weaknesses.. We recently compared a Delos and an XW and the views were near on identical we also compared a Nagler to a Tak LE and both felt the Tak showed more fine detail.. ""Horses for courses"" comes to mind......",0
"Wow!!! That's all I can say. I do think that there are some TV fanatics among us, but apparently there are also Brandon and Nikon and Zeiss fanatics - just pick a brand. TV eyepieces aren't always better in every respect than inexpensive competition. They do make amateur eyepieces to relatively high standards. So do other manufacturers (or should I say vendors who have their product manufactured offshore, just like TV does?). I'd say if you have to ask if brand X is overpriced, it's overpriced for you. There's no point in generalizing. Maybe we all need to take a deep breath..",0
Most excellent advice Shneor!.,0
"Are they worth the price? Depends on how you value that. In my opinion, and I own several, yes and no. Long before I ever heard of TeleVue I was happy observing with my Orion Stratus eyepieces. Those were/are far from perfect, but I didn't care. I spent more nights out observing using a XT10 and the 21mm, 17mm, 13mm and 5mm Stratus and Hyperion eyepieces and had a blast doing that. So are the overpriced? In my opinion, yep. Having said that let me say I own the following TeleVue eyepieces in order of use and love:. 22mm T4 Nagler. 31mm T5 Nagler. 26mm T5 Nagler. 35mm Panoptic. 27mm Panoptic. 12mm Delos. 10mm Delos. 8mm Delos. 14mm Delos. 17.3mm Delos. Paracorr Type II. I have also owned:. 11mm Delite. 7mm Delite. 24mm Panoptic. So why do I say overpriced? Because I firmly believe that you do not have to pay out thousand of dollars of hard earned cash to enjoy observing many many objects in the night sky. For that matter, I also own the 3.5,5,7,10,14 and 20mm Pentax XW (my main eyepieces). I also own some Explore Scientific 82 and 68 degree eyepieces (30mm, 18mm, 11mm 82 degree, 24mm and 20mm 68 degree) three type of Orthos and a few other eyepieces. I guess I am a snob and I guess I am opposite of saying yeah, I paid way too much money for all of these. They are overpriced. Why did I do that? Because one night in Utah's West Desert a friend loaned me his Pentax XW in the 10mm, 20mm and 30mm eyepieces. Guess what? I instantly saw the difference in the eyepieces. So I began to add one at a time, paying cash until I had each one listed. My wife would roll her eyes and say ""REALLY?"" Yep, and I purchased them and am glad I did. They do make a difference in my visual observing.. So there you have it. Do you have to spend money and investi n the TeleVue or Pentax XW or Nikon or other premium lines in order to enjoy the hobby? Nope, not at all. So in my book yep, the ""premium"" eyepieces are over priced but suckers like me that look through them and go WOW!!! and keep going WOW!!! everytime I use say my 22mm T4 Nagler or my 10mm Pentax XW or my 12mm Delos, then yes, they were overpriced but well worth the cost of admission. It really comes down to whether one wants to pay them. I've tried most of mine out before buying with someone else, but not all, but that helped me to know if I wanted to pay the overprice. So there you go. Overpriced? Yep, they are a LOT of money. Worth it? I cannot speak for anyone else but for me they are as I paid cash for them and enjoy my work horses when in the field. I fear based on the last month though that they are in for a long winter's nap in their eyepiece case. Oh well, I've gotten a couple of snowshoeing outings in. Guess that is a good analogy also. I pay top rate for the elite and best snowshoes because of what the shoe will do in a variety of conditions and locations. I want the options to have the best and to use them when I need or want to. Eyepieces are like that. You don't have to spend the money to enjoy the hobby. If you can save and pay cash, then over time you'll have a collection that you can use in a variety of conditions, on a variety of objects and in a variety of locations. You'll know what eyepiece to use in the conditions, both at the ground and in the sky to maximize your observing. Paying for that, yeah, I can over time, but again, those old Orion Stratus eyepieces, though not perfect, did a good job of having me enjoy my time at my scope. In the end, THAT is what is about. Enjoy time at your scope and away from the grind of everyday life. At least for me..",0
"Actually I plan to get at least one good TV eyepiece to see what the big deal is all about and to reward the company's innovation and dedication to the hobby and general high standards. Televue is also kind of local-to-me and I support that. That stuff means a lot to me whether in this hobby or other hobbies or work related fields so sometimes it's fine to spend extra for those reasons. As I build up I'll be totally open to other brands both new and used, greatly aided by the very fine advice here at CN.. That all said, the last few days the clothes dryer looks like it is giving up the ghost so a new replacement will be coming out of my astro-toy account. If it ain't one thing it's another, last year it was a new chimney and heating system, year before major roof repair.... sigh..",0
"A friend who managed a machine shop used to say with a smile:. ""You can buy better but you can't pay more.."". As Mitrovarr said, I dont necessarily recommend TeleVue or other expensive eyepieces to someone just starting out. There are other good eyepieces and other good eyepieces that are much more affordable. The time to invest in TeleVue eyepieces is when you have enough experience to know they are what you want...

"I am sure Roland is interested in profitable growth and success. But that is not his number one priority, it wasn't his motivation in founding Astro-Physics. Sometimes having a ""higher"" priority is actually the key to success and profit.. From what I have read, John Dieblel, the founder of Meade, once told Roland he was going to put him out of business with the Meade ED refractors. ""It didn't quite turn out that way"", said Roland smilingly.... I think of Roland as someone whose ultimate goal is to build himself the equipment he wants to have. It started out with making the best possible refractors. At that point he realized better mounts were needed for those refractors so he started to build his own mounts. But to understand why the mount business in larger, one has to understand Roland, he is a perfectionist, as long as every Astro-Physics refractor is figured and tested by Roland, there will be a limited number available. He is not a machinist and he trusts the machining to someone else.. They would only have themselves to blame. As long as I can remember, Roland has said that there are other high quality scopes to choose from, it is not necessary to wait for an Astro-Physics scope to get yourself a high quality instrument. ""P.S. And for the fellow that asked about a scope since 2007 in the Cloudy night's post above - yes, consider purchasing a scope from the many fine instruments available. I probably won't get around to making your scope ever, and that is not a bad thing. There are so many choices now that you should never wait if you really want a scope."".

"LOL you're name says it all.... Sounds like this guy I knew once on these forums, who could afford to buy 10 new mediocre eyepieces at 40-50$ each (which he than complained about most of them) instead of buying 1-3 new or used good eyepieces so instead he ended up hating everyone for having TV and Pentax eyepieces...so he just quit suddenly the hobby just mad at everything and everyone...funny story.... There are no fanboys in this hobby, just intelligent people buying products that best suit their needs from different suppliers. Fanboys belong in games or something, not sure where that word was started... Just buy what you feel like buying, but do some research first as it pays off, ask people on forums for advice and don't mind what others own or buy etc...not sure what that rant post was for to be honest...lol..",0

"I think Televue eyepieces are expensive but not overpriced. I belong a bit to the fanboy group, having heard of the famous Naglers since the early 80's. I got my first Televue last new years, a new 10 mm Radian EP that was the last in stock at Radio City in Minneapolis, and once I had it and looked through it a few times I new I had made a good choice. M13 was spectacular in it with my Dob even without coma correction. When I got my scope I got the 14.5, 9, & 5 mm Orion expansion EP kit and it opened up the sky to me more than the stock plossl did. But after getting the TV Radian I realized the mistake I had made. I wanted to much for two little. I got a 35 mm Orion DeepView because I was to cheap and to impatient to get a ES or TV EP. I just donated the 35 mm to my astronomy club as a door prize. It was just a reminder of my stupidity and impatience in purchasing. Had I spend that much on on one EP originally IT would have been better for me, and I suspect the same for most people. Research your scope, research the eyepieces and get a really good one, it's more than worth it.. Since then I got a 2.5 times Powermate and recently a used 22 Panoptic and I'm never going for cheap again. It doesn't have to be Televue but it's hard to go wrong with them.. happy observing and Merry Christmas.. Harvey.",0
"All eyepieces are overpriced, especially if you buy them..",0
"WARNING: This hits upon a pet peeve of mine; read on at your own risk!. In a free market, a non-essential item is ""overpriced"" if and only if it is not yielding sufficient profit. So any item that is selling at a price, and in a quantity, to yield a satisfactory profit through the supply chain is not ""overpriced,"" by definition.. Televue eyepieces seem to sell at a good clip. Televue seems to be thriving as a company. So it is absurd to suggest that their products are ""overpriced"" (using any rational and informed definition of the word).. Now, people certainly are entitled to say that they don't think that the products are ""worth it."" But that's not the same thing, since it involves one's personal finances and how much one values a particular product. For instance, I like watches, and own a few very fine ones. To me, Rolexes are ""not worth it,"" although I have spent enough on other watches to have bought Rolexes instead, had I wanted them. Since Rolex sells upward of a million new watches each year, it would be silly to assert that they are ""overpriced,"" but, given my value system, they are not ""worth it"" to me. The same could be said by people about Televue eyepieces (although I would not be one of those people).. Mark.",0
"That to me feels like just a quibble over word definitions. The 'worth it' argument is clearly what was intended here, not some economist/business idea of being overpriced relative to the perceived market value..",0
"The original post:. ""Are they really worth the price (despite being manufactured in Taiwan for some of them) or do you pay mega premium prices just because of the Televue tag?Honest and ego-free replies please!"". Exactly how one interprets the question is open to discussion and the answer depends on the individual. Personally, I built my eyepiece set one eyepiece at a time over a period of about 15 years. Started at the bottom of the chain and worked my way up.  The acquisition of a 12.5 inch F/4.06 about 15 years ago steered the process towards eyepieces that worked well at F/4 and when I purchased my first TeleVue eyepiece, a used 24 mm WF, I was immediately struck by just how sharp it was in comparison to my other eyepieces. But I was both stubborn and underfunded so I continued to buy a variety of eyepieces but slowly gravitated towards the realization that for me, for my Scopes, for the way I observe, TeleVue eyepieces are better performers and I ended up with a case full of Naglers and Panoptics. All that basically transpired prior to the arrival of the Explore Scientific eyepieces and the Meade Series 5000s. Now that funds are more available, I am still cheap so my first trip into the 100 degree eyepiece market was the 20 mm ES 100 degree. It's actually a pretty good eyepiece but after some months of use I came to realize there we're issues with it, it wasn't as clean and sharp across the field as my old 20 mm Type 2 Nagler, the field wasn't evenly illuminated, it had the brighter edge. The ES went back into the other eyepieces bag and the type 2 was back in the main case.. Other ES eyepieces I have looked through weren't quite up to what I had gotten used to with the TeleVues. I think ES eyepieces are represent very good values and recommend them, but for me, TeleVue eyepieces are definitely worth it, this guy is not spending the big money just for the name tag, I buy them to use and I do use them, a lot.. I personally think some sort of balance between the investment in eyepieces and in Scopes and mounts is worth considering. $2000 worth of eyepieces and a $300 scope doesn't make sense to me, a better scope with show you more.. On the hand, say one invests in a a fancy scope like the TV NP-10, $4000 new, $2000 used, it doesn't make sense to me to have anything but the best eyepieces to go with it.. A balance... Bottom line : I'm an engineer/scientist. What matters to me is what I see in the eyepiece. My wife and I have invested some real money in a place where the skies are dark and clear. I have assembled a nice group of very nice telescopes that are well suited for what I line to do.. It doesn't make sense to cut corners on the eyepieces... Jon.",0
"In answer to the very original question by the OP.. TV eyepieces offer opportunities to see the universe with very special ""eyes"". Opportunities in life are priceless..",0
"By spending a lot of money on your eyepieces, you'll be giving up other opportunities. You could easily fit a binoviewer in the difference between 3 Naglers and 3 ES82s, for instance..",0
"What I'd recommend doing is look at your kit as a whole and assess whether the money spent would be worth more somewhere else.. Other manufacturer's eyepieces are often really good. If Tele-Vue Naglers are defined as 10 out of 10s on a scale (we'll define 1 as a cheap Chinese plossl, serviceable but not excellent), from what I've seen, I'd have to put ES82s and Meade UWAs around an 8 (it varies somewhat by focal length and design). Tele-Vue is usually better than the alternatives, but not shockingly better. But it does cost a lot more. So, if there are any holes or deficiencies in your kit, it might make more sense to get cheaper eyepieces and fix those instead. It depends a lot on how much money you have. For instance, if you just have a standard-issue unmodified Chinese dob and the starter eyepieces, I'd recommend adding or fixing a ton of stuff before I'd recommend worrying about Tele-Vue eyepieces. There are loads of things more important than the difference between an ES82 and a Nagler..",0
"On the other hand, you might keep the Nagler the rest of your life, you might eventually replace the ES with a TV... For this thread, I think it's best to share ones own story, how it relates to yourself, myself.. Jon.",0
"Well, for me, I went for ages using nothing but Plossls and such because I couldn't afford Tele-Vue stuff. Then, Meade was abandoning their SWA line and there was a deep sale. I picked up a 20 SWA for $50 or so, not really expecting a lot because it was a 'cheap widefield'.. It was fantastic. I was instantly addicted to wide fields. It has been a major element in my kit ever since; probably my most used eyepiece. As I got a little bit less broke, I purchased a 14 Meade UWA and a 20 Meade UWA and those were also really, really good. Along they way I also picked up a T1 Nagler 7mm and a 10mm Delos. And yes, they're better. But the differences are pretty minor and I don't feel any pressing need to upgrade the others.. So I guess what I'd say is that if you can buy TV right off the bat, it's probably worth it. However, if you can't afford TV now or in the near future or cannot convince yourself to actually spend the money, the second-tier stuff is definitely worth having. Don't let the existence of TV stop you from buying it if you're not going to actually buy the TV stuff, or need years to build up the money. And ES stuff resells very well, particularly if purchased on sale and sold when the sales are off..",0
"I think that this last couple posts goes to the point of contention and the problem with trying to answer subjective questions such as ""is product X worth it?"" One perspective clearly brought forth in this thread is the idea of value based on price as a function of the cost to manufacture and observed improvement in optical quality. A second point of view is value is described as price as a function of whether or not I need this increased benefit to have fun in the hobby? Either approach is valid, depending on one's own philosophical bent and personal situation.. With that in mind, I would turn the question back to the OP, What is it you value most about your experience in this hobby? That more than anything else will determine whether a TV EP or any other piece of gear represents a good value to YOU.. Cheers!. JMD.",0
"My personal journey has evolved this way:. A decade ago I bought my first 8 inch reflector used for $300 and when looking for eyepieces I thought the TV naglers (at $250 used) were more than I could afford (I bought celestron plossls). But boy did I ever yearn for them because they represented nirvana to me.. A couple of years later when I got the opportunity to try them (T4s) for a weekend I was underwhelmed and thought them overpriced for what they offered.. Another couple of years later, after going through Meade UWAs 5K, I re-evaluated the T4s, and now I felt they were something worth having, bought them used, and was satisfied and thought them worth the money.. Another couple of years later I bought the speers-waler series 2 and felt they were on par with the naglers with a much better price and now felt the weight of extra capital tied in the T4s, and sold em.. Something similar happened with ES 20mm 100 deg (good performance and good value for money) sold in favor or 21mm Ethos (bettter performance, not cheap) which was sold in favor of Lunt XWA 20m (similar performance as 21mm Ethos but at less than half priced used compared to used ethos).. Some of my decisions have been more emotional than rational but I am glad I went through this process and would not have it any other way. It was worth learning that the excitement of new-to-me eyepieces invariably wears off, that a perfectly good eyepiece may not be the right one for me, that higher price does not guarantee higher satisfaction, that a higher price is worth it for the right eyepiece, that getting the right eyepiece (at any price) is still only the beginning of the journey.. And at times such as this thread - having the experience of ""been there, done that"" is worth the price of shipping to understand what everyone else means.. So having owned and sold 12t4, 22T4, 20T2, 13 Ethos, and 21Ethos I think they are expensive but worth the money if one finds value in what they have to offer..",0

"I don't think it applies here nearly as much. Tools break.

"I'm not so sure about that. The loss on reselling a cheap eyepiece is fractionally quite large, and shipping is a major chunk. It falls under the category of ""why bother?""

More importantly, when the funds are available at the outset, I like to buy the right eyepiece the first time, rather than second guessing myself later and buying another later.

Well that's a different problem and not one of Tele Vues creation..",0
"I agree.. Most eyepieces are really quite good. It generally comes down to what you have in the way telescopes, what you like.... In terms of the guitar analogy, you have to know what you want. Some like the Les Paul, some like the Tele, some like the Strat. And some like a Martin. Until you've played a while, you don't really know what you like, what fits your style...

"If you actually knew what the right eyepiece was, there is a certain sense in trying to buy right the first time. But experience is the best teacher and having the experience to really know what the right eyepiece is, where does that come from?. Buying an eyepiece and selling it and buying it back, that doesn't make sense but it probably only costs you about $10... The economics of buying used eyepieces, shipping is minimal, if you know the market, you can sell it for what you paid.. It works out. For a $30 eyepiece, not so much but for a $100 eyepiece, it's great.. Jon.",0
"Hmm... Les Pauls and Teles go great together. Well, pre-61 LP Juniors and pre-72 single-tree Teles (and especially 50s Esquires). Both have distinctive, inherent character: single coils with nasal midrange and attitude or cutting/twangy bridge brightness with/or smooth and smokey neck darkness... Yum. Regular Les Pauls and Strats? Eh, boring multi-tools that sound like, well, whatever you want them to.. And a little mid-50s ladder-braced Gibson acoustic pairs wonderfully with a sweeter sounding larger old Martin (the forward, woody character of the Gibson will likely stand out in a circle).. And, why aren't we talking about clay dot, unbound Jazzmasters? Or putting a variac before the glowing tubes in that old Fender amp?. Wait, what was the question? Oops.... Okay, on-topic: It's ""Tele Vue."" Two words. No hyphen.",0
"I think the biggest problem with this thread is the definition of ""overpriced.""   To me it means that the priced established by the seller is more than what is considered the norm for a particular product.    Now, if the seller can show the buyer that the extra cost above the norm is worth the price and it seems acceptable to the buyer that item is not overpriced. However to those who feel the extras that drive the product above normal are not worth the extra cost it is overpriced.  So, by that definition it would be a personal decision. Now. I believe we would all agree that TV eyepieces cost a bit more then others.   Thus,  If I really need an extremely good planetary EP(or for that matter any type of TV eyepiece) and believed TV plossls were the best in this area u could argue they are not overpriced.   And the opposite would be true.   Their extra cost is just not worth the advantage or perhaps u don't see a real advantage to the extra cost.  There are valid points to either side of the argument.",0
"YES. There are several definitions of ""overpriced"" kicking around here. I think the relevant one has to do with diminishing returns.We know that more money buys more quality, but not linearly. A Rolex watch is better than a Bulova, and a Bulova is better than a Timex, and a Timex is better than a dollar-store watch, but most people would agree that somewhere around Bulova, diminishing returns set in -- as the price goes up further, the quality is not increasing as much as the price is. My own feeling is that Tele Vue Plössls are above the point of diminishing returns -- they are very good, but you can get 90% of the quality for a good bit less than 90% of the price. And that is Tele Vue's doing -- they inspired a lot of competition. Plössls used to be scarce, before they popularized them.And I think Tele Vue understands that. They are making premium Plössls, not just serviceable ones.Where I think they shine is their innovative designs. I haven't seen anything else that quite competes with the DeLite, for example -- certainly not anything priced appreciably less than the DeLite. Same for a long chain of designs going back to the Nagler. Several of them have set new standards which competitors scrambled to compete with, and that benefited all of us..",0
"They call it ""the market."". It seems they have a lot of very satisfied customers willing to pay ""the market price"" for their instruments..",0
"My co-workers can't believe the money I spend on TV eyepieces. A few of them are also intro astronomy. However one of my co-workers is my hunting buddy. He has a Nikon scope that costs more than my 21 Ethos, a tricked out hunting magnum rifle that costs more than a 4"" APO. He wears $300 camo. Has a $1200 bow with probably another $600 into accessories - sight, stablizers, etc.  He is as passionate about his hunting gear as I am my astronomy gear. I hunt with a modest Remington 700 30-06 with an entry level Leupold scope - maybe $750 when bought new 10 years ago. My archery equipment is nice but it's only about $650 fully equipped for everything. I wear Walmart Camo - $50 maybe. I didn't even score a quota permit this year so I probably won't even be able to go this season. Incidentally, he is the only person that understands spending the money I have on TV - he get's it and he's not even into astronomy. Actually, my wife get's it too which is great. There are limits but she understands buy ""quality"" the first time. Now, I'm not a TV snob - it can be Pentax, Nikon, Vixen there are more I am sure a lot of good quality manufacturers. I finally achieved what I consider a minimalist complete set of all TV eyepieces this year after 3 years of buying and selling. cheers. k.",0
"Lenny, your thread started out about TV Plossls and has been mildly hijacked in multiple directions so as to evolve into a truly great thread.

"First:. Let's stop talking about TeleVue Plossl's. They are not a typical TeleVue product and not representative of TeleVue eyepieces. Lets discuss why buy an Ethos, a Nagler, a Panoptic, a Delos, a Delite, a Powermate, a Paracorr ll. These are the products, along with their refractors, that set TeleVue apart from the others.. Second:. The norm for a particular product is based on the view that an item is a commodity. But eyepieces at this level are not commodities, they are not generic. When your product is was revolutionary, continues to be revolutionary, established the market for such eyepieces and continues to be the standard for comparison, there is no established price for the particular product. I think the Rolex is worth considering in depth. As a time keeping device, is the Rolex more accurate than a $30 Quartz Timex? It's my understanding that the Timex keeps better time. In terms of diminishing returns, that's a question of value and a decision we each have to make. But I divorce my own value judgment from the question of price, overpriced. A couple of years ago we purchased a small piece of glass, less than 1"" x 1"" in dimension at a cost of about $4000. If you just needed a piece of glass, that's a poor value.  But it was an Etalon figured to Lambda/400 at a particular wave length. I look at something like an eyepiece, an Etalon, from a slightly different perspective. The role of the eyepiece is not to screw up the image that exists at the focal plane. The measure of an eyepiece is how much it deviates from perfect. A 90% perfect eyepiece provides a good view, a 95% perfect eyepiece is about twice as good in terms of not messing up the image and you should expect to pay at least twice as much. A 99% perfect eyepiece is 5X more perfect than a 95% perfect eyepiece.. and one should expect to pay accordingly. Whether you are satisfied with that 90% perfect eyepiece, that's up to you.. whether you want to buy that lambda/400 etalon, that's up to you.... Just some thoughts.. Jon.",0
"Yes, exactly. It is a matter of individual taste (and means) how far to go past the point of diminishing returns. Sometimes we *do* want to pay 50% more money for 5% more quality.. Especially in 2 situations:. - That 50% is not a large part of the price of the whole system. For instance, on a $5000 telescope you probably won't care about an extra $50 for the eyepiece. On a $100 telescope for a child or a funds-limited beginner, you would.. - Whether you want assurance that the eyepiece is not the weak link in the chain, or at least is not susceptible to further upgrade. That is, buy a really good one and you don't have to think about eyepieces any more; you know that what you see is limited by other things, not the eyepiece.. The two concepts can be combined. The weakest link in the chain is where you spend more money. For instance, that hypothetical $100 telescope for a beginner would benefit more from $50 more of mount than from $50 more of eyepiece.. Another point about eyepieces is that they don't wear out. The DeLite that I bought last year will still be perfectly usable by my grandchildren 50 years from now.. BTW, I'm not sure about Rolex vs. Timex timekeeping. Aren't both of them quartz-based? Rolex probably uses better-selected, temperature-compensated crystals and would get a slight edge in timekeeping. I'm just speculating. But both should be very good. Currently I'm wearing a $25 Casio that beats 'em both by using a different technology -- it listens to WWVB and sets itself!.",0

One other factor is if a user has 15% of perfect eyes then maybe a 100% of perfect eyepiece. Same applies for the optic it's being used in..,0
"Slight return to the ""plossl"", when they were considered the next step up from the supplied eyepieces here yes they cost more but the one aspect that was usually taken into account was that no one ever seemed to have a poor TV plossl. They all worked and worked well.. I do wish I could get a car that followed the same lines.. Maybe the price has the be considered against more then just other sounding similar eyepieces available. Maybe 95% of ES eyepieces work fine but do you want to be in the 5% that is on the receiving end of one that does not quite perform?. Baader Hyperons have a following but people are honest and say they do not peform well in ""fast"" scopes, but most scopes are ""fast"" these days, and really for what is a £100 eyepiece here I think they should be better..",0
"Shipping alone hascost memore than that, and if any of the purchases are new the sales tax is lost, not to mention the loss on the resale.While the used marketis pretty much required if you want to try a lot of eyepieces rather than pick a few, I can't see how the economics work out for that, especially when time is factored in. It is more about minimizing the cost to experiment with alot of eyepieces, accepting the time, shipping, and other potential losses. A bad deal or having to send one off for service (paying shipping two more times as well as for the work) will wipe out thesavings of a used eyepiece pretty rapidly..",0
Bad deals are pretty easy to avoid through simple research and sending eyepieces off for service is almost never necessary..,0
"A SHORT TELE VUE FAIRY TALE. My first Tele Vue was, if I remember correctly, a 26mm Plossl bought new around 1980. At that point in time, I was pretty happy with the eyepieces I had, except in the 24 to 26mm range, where nothing seemed to work well with my 6"" f4 RFT scope. I had gone through about 3 eyepieces and was using ""the best one of the worst"" which I think was a 25mm Celestron silvertop Plossl. Then I got the Tele Vue Plossl and it just blew me away completely! It was so much better in every respect...contrast, center sharpness, edge sharpness, viewing comfort. I finally had an eyepiece in that focal range that earned my respect. Just holding that eyepiece in my hand was like touching a Ferrari. The build quality was extraordinary, like no other eyepiece I had ever seen. Then, not too long after that, the first Naglers were released and it was about that time when I finished construction on the 17.5"" f4.5. So I jumped on a 9mm and a 13mm Type 1 Nagler. Those eyepieces were an incredible match for that scope in every way possible. Worth every penny and I couldn't ever imagine using that scope without them. The combination of the 82-degree field-of-view and pin-point stars to the edge was like being in space. So I sold the 26mm TV Plossl most of my other eyepieces to help fund the Naglers, both of which I still have (even by today's standards, the 9mm is a real gem). I was accused on more than one occasion of having 3 wives...the skinny 9mm, the chubby 13mm and the size 7. And the size 7 ALWAYS thought I loved the 9mm and 13mm more than her. She once said, ""sure, you sleep with me but you're always dreaming about the 9mm and the 13mm. Somehow I just know those 9mm and 13mm Naglers put a big smile on my face while I'm dreaming. So I tend to dream a lot. Ahh, and then there are the mistresses, the 22mm Nagler Type 4 and the 8mm Delos, but that's a story for another time..",0
Nothing else re shaped our hobby like Tele Vue has done. There were no really good eyepieces before Tele Vue was around..,0
"Well, my Clavé Plössls weren't too bad.........",0
"I'll give you that those were good planetary eyepieces but, on one of today's f3.5 to f4.5 instruments, my guess is that they probably wouldn't perform up to the Clavé name. For deep-sky, I'm guessing they would be like looking through a narrow tunnel. As a matter of interest, I had a set of Brandons that worked poorly on my old 8"" f4.5 Cave so, to this day, I think very poorly of those eyepieces. Tele Vue was the first to recognize the Dob revolution and respond with Plossls that worked well enough with short focal ratios and, of course the Naglers were in a league of their own when they came out..",0
"What?! No Ukuleles? No Martin, Kamaka or Kanile'a?.",0
"That seems like quite an overstatement. Orthos and plossls just have a narrow FOV, they're not bad. Erfles and Konigs are good in long F/Ls, like SCTs. Tele-Vue made some progress but I thing that things would have advanced without them, too. Maybe not as quickly, but it still would have happened..",0
"Not currently. I've had a few 1920s Martin ukes (both mahogany and koa tops), and even an early Gibson, in the past. (I might have lap steels.  ).",0
"The breakthrough (TV introduced) was not the Nagler line (82º) but the much bigger gamble that amateur astronomers would part with as much money as TV's initial small volume would need to recoup the investment.. But contrary to many threads about cheapo eyepieces and what amateurs would pay;. amateurs did drop the cache, and history was made..",0
Or my Brandon's..,0
Had some Claves back in the 80's and they did nothing for me. I love the FOV and ER of the Radians and Delites the best..,0
"I was speaking of FOV and ER the most. I started out with crappy 965OD eyepieces and then had the normal 1.25"" stuff until i bought my first Nagler sometimes in the 90's. That Nagler sure did open my eyes.  Seems eyepiece tech was pretty dead in the late 70's.. My first Tele Vue products was the 32mm plossl and 1.8"" Barlow in 1986. I was hooked then on..",0
No over statement at all when the first Naglers came out in the early 80's. That just changed the game more than any product i can think of. Then i gotta give the Paracorr the next biggest game changer.. They both changed my world..,0
"I would say that Al Nagler changed (transformed) the hobby of modern visual amateur astronomy, as much as, and in conjunction with,John Dobson...  Any other MAJOR innovators that have even come close to these two individuals? Granted many have made advances, but these two have defined what visual amateur astronomy has become today, it is truly a great time to be in the hobby..  Jaimo!.",0
Tom Johnson and John Diebel. Their influence is still rippling through the field..,0
Newton!,0
"There hasn't been much mention of Tele Vue Barlows. I must have tried at least a half dozen Barlows when I got a 2.5x 1.25"" Tele Vue Barlow in the early 80's. WOW, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!! I had never used any Barlow like it before...absolutely no image degradation, superb contrast, no crazy internal reflections or flare, and razor-sharp images. For me, that was a game changer. Since then, Tele Vue has not ignored these very useful tools. They still sell regular Barlows and now have the Powermate series in 1.25"" and 2"", excellent for both visual and photographic use. Seems the best planetary and lunar photographers are using 3x, 4x, and 5x Powermates these days. Recently, got my nephew an 1.25"" 3-element 2x Celestron Barlow and it'll work okay for him only because he doesn't know a crappy Barlow from a good one yet (I tested it myself and performance was less than steller to say the least but, hey, it was only $29). Then I recently needed a 2"" Barlow and my pockets weren't quite deep enough for a 2"" Powermate, so I got a 2"" Astro-Tech (GSO) ED Barlow. It's optically a ""pretty good"" Barlow but the internal tube blackening is very low grade and the lens coatings are terrible so eyepiece field lenses tend to get reflected back off the Barlow lens itself which doesn't look like it has any edge blackening either. Not a good thing. So it looks like there's a Tele Vue Powermate in my future. Yeah, Tele Vues make very expensive Barlows but they seem to do the job like no others. By the way, I'm loosely applying the ""Barlow"" name to the Powermates as well, even though purists would say that they're not actually Barlows..",0
"What John Dobson did more than anything else was change a mindset of what constituted an astronomical telescope.. Dobson didn't create anything new per se, rather he successfully married two very old ideas (the Newtonian optical system and cannon mount) in a way no one had seriously considered before due to pre-conceptions. Brilliant and simple at the same time.. And given his background and means, he had no choice but to do it on a shoestring. It was only natural that others would take the ball and run with it, refining the design and substituting more expensive components along the way..",0
"Jeff, My take on John Dobson is that he ""broke all the rules"" when it came to traditional telescope making and you're right that his scopes were built that way of economic necessity. First time I met John Dobson was in the late 1960's at Fremont Peak in CA and the S.F. Sidewalk Astronomers had their 15-inch scope ""Cyclops"" set up. That night was also a San Jose Astronomy Club star party so everyone was out in force with their 6-inch and ""big-for-the-time"" 8-inch scopes. Observers ventured up the hill for a peek thru the 15-inch and then, in total disdain, they turned around, went back down the hill to spend the rest of the night with their 6 and 8-inch scopes. In less than an hour, the crowd around the 18 had completely cleared out. ""It's not a REAL telescope"" they said, ""It's junk"" they said, ""The mirror's a battleship porthole"" they said. Meanwhile, I HAD A WILDLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF THINGS. I didn't care that the primary mirror was way too thin, supported by a sling, not made of Pyrex but rather WWII porthole plate glass, or that the secondary was glued in with 3 wooden struts that adjusted by pushing and pulling them forward and backward against the inside of the big tube (no screws anywhere), that the telescope tube was thick cardboard (Sonotube), the mount moved on Nylon pads instead of steel ball bearings, the focuser was push-pull, and the eyepiece was a crappy old binocular eyepiece. Yes it really was a junkyard telescope but that meant nothing to me. What I saw was that this thing really worked and it worked better than anything I had ever looked through. It also called to me...""build one of me for yourself, anyone can do it"". Then, looking thru the 15-inch, I saw my first dark nebula ever, Bernard 86 with a nice open star cluster next to it...amazing! And M22...WOW, surely there were a million stars in the eyepiece! And all the fine wispy details in the Swan Nebula...that was like nothing I'd ever seen! Months later, at another Fremont Peak star party, John and his Sidewalk Astronomers were very tired as they had already been on the mountain for a couple of nights. They also brought a bigger scope, an 18-inch (""The Little One"") scope. Around 11pm John turned to me and said, ""The Little One is all yours, enjoy it and don't leave it pointed toward the sunrise in the morning."" For the next 5 hours I was Sir John Herschel himself. I don't think I was ever the same after that and, to this day, I can't forget the negative attitude most of the other amateurs had towards John Dobson's big scopes. Fortunately, not everyone shared that opinion, as the scopes became known as Dobsonians and a new telescope-making revolution was started. That revolution brought many improvements to John's original designs (like replacing Nylon with Teflon) and ushered in developments like Al Nagler's namesake eyepieces. Can you imagine pushing a Dobsonian around the sky today using only 55 to 60-degree FOV eyepieces? You would probably spend more time moving the scope than observing. The Tele Vue 82-degree Naglers helped make it all possible and now the Ethos 100-degree eyepieces are continuing that tradition. So a huge thank you from me to the late John Dobson and to Al Nagler. Talk about a match made in heaven...both of you took amateur astronomy to a whole new level of appreciation and enjoyment that simply can't be measured and has since exploded worldwide. Whew!..sorry for such a long post...can you tell I'm just a bit enthusiastic?.",0
"Niteguy,. Awesome post! Are Televue eyepieces overpriced? To a large number of amateur astronomers, apparently not. That settles it. If the company is still in business, then it means that we find the products priced right for what they offer. There will be dissenting opinions - always - but the proof is in the pudding. The Naglers are still in business, still innovating and still selling eyepieces and scopes and mounts and many other accessories.. And they've been around for decades. It there was a scam involved with their eyepieces, I don't think it would remain hidden for so long. Therefore, the eyepieces are correctly priced for the market according to the criteria of the person that sets the price after taking into account market forces - the Naglers.. End of story....",0
"Wow, that was some bit of history.  Extremely enjoyable and informative.    Thanks.",0
Or get a used Big barlow from Tele Vue..,0
Boy....This post sure has some legs to it. I thought by now it would have have petered out but it seems there is a lot of passion for this subject.. Allow me to toss in my 2 bits as a relative newbie to this sport.. I got my first telescope about a year ago and like everyone else went through the agonizing process of acquiring eyepieces. Without the benefit of a mentor I learned just everything about amateur astronomy from reading Cloudy Nights. Much to my surprise eyepiece selection it seemed was far more complicated than buying a telescope. So many choices so many opinions and seemingly all very subjective. Terms like EOFB were bantered about which meant nothing to me. I really could care less as I was having the time of my life with my new telescope. The cost of TV's really put me off so I invested in some moderately priced eyepieces trying to buy used if at all possible. Then about a month ago the TV's were on sale so I bought a 14 mm Delos to replace my similar brand X eyepiece which originally I thought was great but after many nights found it wanting. Well after looking at a just a few objects with the Delos and comparing it to my original eyepiece and I finally figured out what EOFB was. Why? Because my Delos didn't have any... The way I see it if you think your going to stick with this sport for a few years the additional cost of TV's or any other quality product amortized over a few years will only amount to a few dollars extra every observing session. Think about that the next time you have one of those near perfect nights and ask yourself if it was possible would you pay another 10 bucks during that session to have the best possible experience??. Would I pay full price for a TV eyepiece? Probably not A bit to pricey for me. Would I buy one used if I could get a good deal. You bet... I think a previous post I read on this was spot on. Are Televue eyepieces overpriced ? No. Just expensive.,0
"My answers are yes, yes, . ah and yes....",0

"Yeah the stick in the muds take decades, mortality tends to be the driver of change..",0
"What a great story. I didn't realize that there were so many observers who held such disdain for John Dobson's scopes, but I guess I shouldn't be too surprised since even now I encounter amateurs who seem to think scopes are meant to be looked at rather than through.",0
"Let's look at some of these ""paradigm shifts,"" shall we?. ​. ​CDs blew away cassettes and LPs, but today the LP market is growing, and new pressing plants are opening to accommodate demand.. ​. ​Quartz watches blew away mechanical watches, except that mechanical watches made a comeback, and not just in the high end of the market. I blame the Chinese (among others).. ​. ​Digital cameras blew away film. Any predictions of what might happen here?. ​. ​One of the problems with electronic viewing blowing away eyepieces is that it hasn't happened yet. I'm sure it will, any time now, like the 2017 being the year of the Linux desktop. No really, it's going to happen....",0
"Yes, John made scopes out of any cheap, or junk materials he could get his hands on, but don't discount his mirror grinding abilities. The man could figure a mirror with the best of them..",0
"I see it differently.. CDs and LPs are almost dead because 90% of all new music is being downloaded, not purchased on hard discs. If you buy it on CD, you're probably older. If you buy it on LP, you're probably nostalgic for your youth, and older.. Watches themselves are on the way out. Young people, by and large, don't wear them but look at their phones to see what time it is.. Cell phone cameras are quickly killing camera sales. It's becoming rarer and rarer to see DSLR photographers places.. Computers are on the verge of all being voice activated. Mine allows me to change screens with hand gestures that don't touch the screen, and I open apps by asking my computer to open them. Soon, it won't matter if it's Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, or whatever comes along so long as you don't have to type to get a computer to do things for you. I send text messages a lot on my phone by voice to text. Why type if your phone can understand you?.",0
"I would call it about an 80% replacement. For example, NV is not suitable for planetary viewing. I am still keeping my conventional eyepieces.. But a huge improvement in 80% of what you do?What is not to like about this?. I'm sure if you were around in 1970, you would nay-saying these newfangled Dobsonian telescopes.. Lots of people laughed at John Dobson in 1970. I'm sure that they felt pretty smart the time, and they did not have to go through the inconvenience of scraping rust off of their imaginations. So, it took his ideas perhaps 12-15 years to go mainstream.. The Dobsonian took faint little smudges and turned them into bright detailed objects.. That it what NV does.. Unlike giant telescopes, NV doesn't weigh 100 pounds. It doesn't take 1-1/2 hours to cool down. It doesn't have to be driven 100 miles to a dark site. It doesn't cost $15,000 and require an additional $3,000 in premium eyepieces and correctors..",0
You guys can buy all the new stuff and i will keep buying the older NJ Tele Vue stuff..,0
"I agree. My wife just bought a Polaroid-type camera, but mostly for retro fun. Film still occupies a small niche for professional photographers but I sure don't see it expanding further, not with the advent of 50 MP DSLR's and digital processing software. By similar token, the recent uptick in watches and vinyl LP's is just to fill a retro niche that may or may not linger.. Definitely don't see typewriters ever coming back like gang busters..",0
"I do both types of observing. They both have their places. Quality Night vision technology is very very expensive still and will likely to continue to be so. Besides the expense of production, the relatively small demand and export control restrictions(yes, if you have a Collins Eyepiece, you are not allowed to take it out of the country) are likely to keep that in the background.  Additionally, for that technology, the quality of your image is very sensitive to the amount of moisture in the air, as are the very highly sensitive Analog cameras whose spectral response reaches well into the IR range.  With respect to the CMOS, CCD sensors, Sony has really driven the revolution in Astrovideo observing. What is possible today with Mallincam, Atik or other types of cameras is nothing short of amazing.  Part of it has been the development of sensors with very high quantum efficiencies(driven by the Cell phone market), and more recently the development of software to do on the fly processing(taking advantage of the advances in computing power).  This all leads to an ability to do what I call ""tourist"" astrophotography. That is not meant to be negative, as that is EXACTLY what I am interested in doing. Getting a quick view and taking a picture to remember it by.  I do not have the time or the patience at this point in my life to do the long duration imaging, although I have great admiration for those who do!  The electronic sensors absolutely magnify what a smaller scope can see, in an amazing way. I have routinely observed and imaged the Horsehead and Flame from my light polluted back yard with 4 and 5 inch scopes on an unguided mount. In COLOR! How amazing is that!  What is on the screen is not going to be an APOD, but it is better than what I would see through the EP in a 4 inch scope, which is basically Alnitak and maybe its companion star. But, it is still a lot of gear. I need power, I need a computer and all that needs to be working right. It makes observing more complicated. And to really get the best, I need to do the image processing. That is ok, because I like doing that. It also is GREAT for out reach when you have a lot of people. But if I am looking at star clusters, star fields, or solar system objects, and I am NOT interested in grabbing images for later, then I typically go to the Eyepiece. It is simple. I can set up in minutes and be looking. I do not even need tracking, just point and go. I much prefer looking at the moon through an eyepiece rather than on the screen.  Looking at planets on the computer screen with my typically unstable atmosphere is also usually not very satisfying as well, watching a highly magnified disk expand and contract and blur can get a bit much. Also, because most cameras generally do not exhibit the dynamic range of which the eye is capable, it can be very difficult(not impossible) to get both a planet and its moons to show up at the same time. This is probably why I like viewing the moon directly, as opposed to electronically.. My point is that one technology does not eclipse the other, they are complimentary. Rather than arguing which is better, we should celebrate that we have such a range of tools. None of it is inexpensive, especially if you do not have the means. But it is also not that crazy expensive compared to other hobbies, especially if you observe a lot.. Cheers!. JMD.",0
"So when do you predict the horse and buggy to replace the car? Or cassette tape to make its big burst on the scene. Selective ""proofs"" are easy. Look at the push back against goto. Then using computers to do remote control. Then imaging. As was said change is slow in amateur astronomy and always gets the it's not real because its not done the old way crew..

"Pure glass still outflanks digital in contrast range and 'eye pixels'.. Not obsolete yet.. In the used arena, digital optics have a lot of issues with age..

Glass is nearly eternal by comparison.. If you have thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours banked in telescope. activity, it seems $300---800 for an EP isn't too bad, amortized..

"There is one thing I forgot to mention that was probably a big factor in the early days of disdain for John's big scopes. The group was, after all, the ""San Francisco"" Sidewalk Astronomers, it was the 1960's and, for the most part, they were hippies or ex-hippies (nothing wrong with that) so their big telescopes got painted in ""Haight-Ashbury hippie-style"" using every color of the rainbow and, of course, lots of big stars. I will say I personally thought the air-brushed paint job on their 24-inch was very cool (the bottom of the tube was the Earth and it transitioned to outer space at the top). For those guys with their 6 and 8-inch telescopes up on the mountain that night, painting any telescope in that manner was ""completely sacrilegious"" to say the least...a few of them probably even tried to call the Pope the next day to complain..",0
"Great point. All the junkiness disappeared the moment you looked through the eyepiece. Even with the crap WWII binocular eyepieces, stars were always crisp and sharp. As I recall, Dobson's scopes were all f/6 or f/7 and, especially with the 24-inch, that meant they required very tall ladders. Yes, John was indeed ""a character"" but the man didn't skimp at all when it came to the quality of figuring those big mirrors. On his own he created special polishing and figuring techniques to make it all work..",0

"That ""hippie"" paint job is some more great stuff.   I graduated from HS in 1971 attending a very conservative catholic school.

Were they serious about the hobby?   By that I mean did they know what they were doing. I ran with some of those guy when I went to college.   They had different issues.",0
"Don, I think audiophile is at least part of the sales of LP, but of course if you're an audiophile you probably are older. They brought vacuum tubes back from the brink of extinction too. But it's still definitely a niche.. Rob, maybe not for stills, but the new Star Wars movies are being shot on film.. I think the question is meant to be subjective. i.e. Do we feel we got what we paid for?As observers, of course we mainly care about how good the image is. But some of us do like that black and green color scheme; I know I do. And the fit and finish of the housing is top-notch too, not just the polish of the glass, or the coatings, or the blackening of surfaces throughout. Tele Vue eyepieces aren't just utilitarian. Could it made more cheaply in a bare metal barrel? Perhaps. But would as many people buy them?.",0
"well, this runs afoul of the ""sucker every minute"" rule, but it does raise the point that what you pay for is brand status. and there are people who would rather drive a lambourghini than a BMW, or a BMW rather than a toyota, or buy a gucci purse or a suit at nordstrom rather than macy's, etc.. are TVs overpriced? the answer is simple. put an ES in your telescope, and look around, then put a comparable TV in your telescope, and look around. now judge what percentage of improvement the TV provided, then calculate the percentage of increase in price that the TV costs. if the price ratio is greater than the view ratio then, yes, they're overpriced.. TVs launched as dob eyepieces, really -- that's why the wide field matters so much and the gross weight so little. you can't appreciate TV until you consider all those happy ƒ/4 dob owners.. but, as a visual astronomer, i have yet to meet a TV eyepiece that beats the price ratio with a view ratio in any scope. especially if your price ratio is set against an ES..",0
"That is a good point.    The fit is excellent and the color scheme is classic and TV does all the little things well.   Does that help with the sell?  Sure.  In fact, it's part of the appeal.    And it's also part of the reason some believe TVs are overpriced.    To many the question is, ""do these improvements help with the EPs actual performance.  Do they enable the TV EP to produce a better visual image?   If that answer is no, or even if you would say the improvements are barely noticeable, one could say that they are overpriced.  The extra cost of the TV EP maybe worth it to some, if not many.  But, that does not mean they are properly priced.   I may pay an extra price of any number of products that is unrelated to or does not improve that products performance.   I may have what I consider a good reason.  However, if u consider the price of that product in relationship to similar products that perform just as well  than u could easily say the more costly product is overpriced.    Just because many are willingly to pay a price that is in excess of the going rate does not mean it is properly priced.  If I remember correctly,  in the world of accounting there is a term for the price one might pay for a company that is in excess of its established value;  ""Goodwell"".   One could be paying for the name or the perceived quality, but in pure accounting terms any prodoct or for that matter a company has an established value.  If u are paying more than that value it is due to ""goodwill"".  And that is what I believe occurs with TV EPs.  Most are willing to pay above the going rate because of ""goodwill"".   The company, TV has an excellent reputation.  The products look better and may perform just a bit better than similar products, and on and on.  That's also why many are so passionate about this issue.   Where some see they are buying not just an eyepiece but the reputation of the company that does all the little things well and is usually on the cutting edge of technology, others see a waste of money and a bit of pride.  I don't believe those differences can be resolved.   But it's fun to try.....lol",0
"Well, for starters, even though as a group I'm sure they loved John Dobson very much, the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers were not a cult, as least in the sense of what we might consider a cult. Even though he had been kicked out of the monastary, John Dobson always kept those philosophies and I suspect that's what people really appreciated about him, along with his sense of humor. The Sidewalk Astronomers were an outreach group and would set up telescopes of all sizes on the street corners of San Francisco and, full moon or not, show people of all walks of life the heavens. Most people on the street had never looked through a telescope in their life. And I think you and I know what a thrill it is to show people things for the first time...both for them and us. With their bigger scopes, the street corners became national parks across the country with thousands of people getting to see objects as they were meant to be seen. To answer your question more specifically, the Sidewalk Astronomers were observers, learning about deep sky objects from John Dobson mostly (who himself was learning) and, just like us today, they appreciated the benefits of dark skies and mountain tops. It also didn't hurt that John always had a good story to tell about every object. Who would have thought that at the same time Dobsonians were being born and painted in rainbow colors, Al Nagler would be designing viewing eyepieces for lunar landing simulators and that those two worlds would collide in a most successful collaboration a decade and a half later? A collaboration that ensured the success of Tele Vue and spawned dozens of new telescope companies..",0
"I like my German car. It's quick, reliable and has a much better level of integration of internal systems and to my personal electronic devices. TeleVue provide that level of quality in eyepieces as well and they spend money on R&D. Those are important to me and if someone wasn't the torch bearer to design the next generation of eyepiece other companies ""model their eyepieces on"".. If you don't have to pay for R&D as a company pushing the boundaries it's a large cost saving. Want the original, want it earlier than the others and with TeleVue build quality? Then spend for the privilege or keep waiting for the Delos and Delite clones..",0
"Astrovideo is still a fundamentally different activity than visual observing. Complexity, support equipment, ""workflow"".. But in general, I agree with you. The end game is an ""electronic eyepiece"" that is real time, sensitive, and color. It will overtake the gallium arsenide detectors. I'm not wedded to the NV technology, I'll jump when electronic detectors get to real-time performance. Even in black and white.. Betting against the advance of electronics over the last 50 years has been a losing bet.. The only question is who is going to adapt it to such a small niche market..",0
"Well, this hippie had years of physics, chemistry, and math and appreciates astrophysics as much as many professional astronomers, so I think being a hippie doesn't preclude being into astronomy and using a telescope..

"In economics classes, they discuss the ""Price-Value"" Curve. Where the two cross is the magic point for a product.. Of course, the Value part of the curve is largely subjective and so where the two curves cross is a subjective evaluation.. ""Properly Priced"" is not an economics term, but implies a ""normal"" amount of profit (not gouging, nor ""dumping"").. Since TeleVue eyepieces cost a lot more to make than many other eyepieces, and profit margins in the entire chain of distribution are small, they would seem to fit the definition. of ""properly-priced"".. Having owned many many eyepieces from a lot of different companies, I have tried to see if increasing the price results in better performance, and it does up to a point.. Personally, I could afford to buy any eyepiece I wanted from any company, but field evaluations always told me that the most expensive eyepieces were not, generally, better than. some at lower prices. They may offer something not found in lower prices, such as wider apparent fields, or longer eye relief, or better-designed eyecups, but not better performance. in terms of edge of field correction, contrast, small spot sizes, flatness of field, and high quality control.. The point of not just diminishing returns, but NO additional returns always turned out to be with TeleVue as I saw it.. You can pay more for almost every niche of eyepiece TeleVue makes, but I never found superior performance in any of them.. That doesn't mean TeleVue is the ONLY company to make eyepieces as good as the current state of the art (it certainly is not), merely that paying more did not, to my eye, result in any more return for the dollar.. There are several companies making eyepieces a LOT more expensive than TeleVue, and they are wonderful eyepieces. But, for me, the performance level seems to stop at TeleVue and not improve above it.. That means that I could pay less than the most expensive prices and still get unsurpassed performance.. So what about people with ""thinner"" wallets? The remarkable thing that has happened over the last decade has been the introduction of eyepieces with very low prices that almost everyone can afford. that are very close to the performance of the state of the art products. THAT is a good thing. And I recommend these all the time for people, knowing they will not be disappointed.. But I suppose one of the things about TeleVue that is most remarkable is how low-priced a state of the art product can be. I have other hobbies, and there is no equivalent to TeleVue in any of them, where a mid-priced. product line equals or surpasses the performance of the most expensive products. I know most people don't look at TeleVue as ""mid-priced"" products, but they are if the prices of eyepieces I see are any indication.. You can pay almost $2200 for a particular Zeiss orthoscopic. How over-priced does that make a $110 TeleVue Plossl seem? Perspective is an interesting thing.",0
"I'm no hippie, but I couldn't agree more with your last point Don.. As far as observing technology (NV or video viewing) I'm sure it's great but not what I want- for no other reason than the fact I want to see the photons hitting my own eyes.. I will make a bold prediction and say that the cd/LP analogy is not transferable to observing, because ""observing"" is precisely about that! The main reason I'm not switching over to this technology is because the NV etc can not compete with images from Hubble and Keck etc you can find on JPL and other websites.. I fail to see the point of observing with any aids other than glass. Just me.   I'm glad those that ar into it enjoy it. CS everyone!.",0
"The price/performance curve flattens out at the top in almost everything. By your definition all products above the linear portion of that curve are overpriced. You have ignored value, which includes perceived price vs perceived performance differences, and these are different for everyone. $600 is expensive for some, pocket change for others, some don't appreciate off axis differences, others do, etc..",0

"Back in 1991, I was writing about future $500 Tele Vue eyepieces (the horror, gulp!). I was also writing about future electronic eyepieces, since I got to use one firsthand in 1988 when I tried an experiment by using my handheld S-VHS camcorder to video Saturn through the club's 16-inch telescope. The results on Saturn really surprised me! So after much experimenting with different zoom settings on the video camera and different eyepieces, I settled on using a 9mm Nagler and got into shooting more seriously. The Super VHS (S-VHS) format delivered at least a third better resolution and that certainly helped. I could SEE (in the camcorder eyepiece) and video details that were impossible visually. For instance, there were details within Jupiter's Red Spot and a shadow transit across the Red Spot, then, despite terrible seeing conditions, follow a star as it transited thru Saturn's Cassini Division, and the real feat for me was to see and video blue clouds, polar cap details, and a couple of actual craters on Mars during its 1988 opposition. What started out as an experiment turned out to be astounding! The camcorder acted as a ""seeing filter"" with its 60 frames-per-second chopping right through most of the air turbulence. In essence, my eye was doing real-time Registax processing by integrating the stream of 1/60th second images. I could NOT see those kind of details visually through the telescope, not even close. The image scale in the camcorder was huge and matching that visually might have required over 1000x, out of the question for sharp visual observing on a 16-inch scope, even one with a 1/20th wave NASA mirror! I did learn that, if I upped the frame rate to 120fps, the image got even better but at the huge expense of brightness and that meant more noise. So, return to 2016, with Sony's high resolution electronic viewfinders (you virtually can't see the pixels) and their full-frame 42 megapixel sensors (from their mirrorless A7RII cameras), we have the makings of our near-future $2000 Tele Vue electronic eyepiece (was that just the wind, or did I hear someone whisper 'overpriced'?). For starters, lunar, planetary, and solar only but in real-time! Come back in another decade and maybe we can talk about real time deep sky with color and ""tuneable"" real-time filters! Of course, once the noise can be minimized enough, you'll be able to crank up the gain and possibly turn your 10-inch telescope into a 30-inch. So, I ask you, if you could do that, wouldn't $2000 be worth it?..or would that be overpriced?.",0
Actually you don't see photons hitting your eye. What you respond to is a chemical electrical reaction in response to photons hitting the rods and cones in your eye..,0
"OK, let's boil down the answers on yet another ""Is Brand X Too Expensive?"" thread..

"Hi Jeff,.  For sure, its always a moving target!;-) I would absolutely love a Collins EP, and if you are talking about a marriage between the convenience of eyepiece observing and the advantages of electronic light amplification then that is where the state of the art is, last time I checked. But they make TV Ethos look cheap. It has been a while since I looked around at that technology. If there are newer entries, I would love to hear about them since most of what I see on the EAA forum is video. But this turn of discussion certainly better for a separate thread.. The key point I feel is important is that there is a price attached to any tool used to view the sky, and whether or not the price of a given technology has value to an individual is largely subjective. Asking a question like the original post is always a double edged sword. On one hand this can lead to some very terse dialog between people who hold very different views, but on the other hand it also leads to some very interesting discussions about the available technologies and the nature of observing itself.. If a person new to the hobby comes to this thread and sifts through the 11+ pages of posts, they will learn about the history of Televue, the history of Dobsonian telescopes, the differences between eyepiece designs, the pros and cons of the different kinds of electronic observation as opposed to looking through and eyepiece. And also that astronomy hobbiests also like sports cars and classic guitars:-) Among many other things. All and all not a bad result. One just has to remember to filter out the more strident commentary.. Cheers!. JMD.",0
This is great for outreach. Scroll down to the outside picture with the group of people.. http://www.cloudynig...ideo-astronomy/.,0
So that is pretty cool!. JMD.,0
"That was very cool and looks like a big hit for outreach programs. What I'm aiming at is something where you can actually view in at least 4K resolution thru an eyepiece, tablet, laptop, or giant 4K flat screen...where you'll actually see the air turbulence in real-time and you can twist knobs to adjust the spectral bandwidth, gain, contrast, etc. all in real-time. That's the real deal that's actually here now for planetary and lunar observers who want a serious DIY project or want to wait until the $2000 model is released from Tele Vue. What you have on the sidewalk has very compressed tones (like early color film astrophotography) and needs much greater image tonal bandwidth to bring out the faint details and prevent burning out the bright details, along with the natural air turbulence, all in real-time where viewers can push buttons and scan around to better view an object, without having to wait for buffering. That model is probably still about a decade away..",0
I think all mid to pro level astronomy equipment is over priced to the point that majority of people will never know what they are missing. Imagine my horror when a TV eyepiece is going for $500 in Canada. And that's before taxes or shipping kicks in. Yes over priced. Sent from my HTC Desire 530 using Tapatalk,0
That's because you love money more than astronomy.,0

"Or....... 4) Most Tele Vue eyepieces do things others might come close to but can't quite match. Is that worth more money? Certainly. So, are they overpriced?

I find it interesting.   When is enough, enough?   Is increasing your cost by 50% worth an 20% or less improvement.   When does your return of improvement per cost diminish till it is no longer viable?  How does one rate an EP?    And on and on and on....... I find it all very interesting.....",0

Some of those decisions were hard to make.   But I made them so I could enjoy the sky.  I soon learned that in order to make good economic purchases required knowledge of the products.  I simply could not buy the best.   I had to think over each purchase and understand the relationship between scopes and eyepieces.

Tele Vue eyepieces are not overpriced. They are worth every penny. IMHO.,0

"If I was going to start again, I'd say to hit every one of your target focal lengths with a cheap plossl or Vite aspheric, then go to ES82s, and then someday go to TV (or another top line) once you know what you want. Cheap EPs are so inexpensive you can buy them without any real risk (and it's nice to have junker EPs for outreach, etc. later). ES82s are so good you won't feel like you're missing much while you learn more about astronomy. You'll need to get some experience before going to top end because there isn't one top line; There's Delos and Ethos, and Naglers, Panoptics, and Delites can also play roles (there are also some lines from other manufacturers, like Pentax and Baader, worth considering). There's also zoom eyepieces and barlows; some people love them, some people hate them. Also, maybe you'll want a binoviewer pair and barlows, or whatever.

People, if someone ever comes around giving away free Ramsdens or Kellners, turn and run away as fast as you can and don't ever look back. Those eyepieces are so bad they're downright evil..",0
"Someone made a post a while back stating if they could start again they would go with some cheap 60 degree EPs.    I own three of the old Meade series 5000 of plossls with 60 degree FOV.    These are the  EPs with the twist up eye cup.  I have the 26, the 14, and the 5.5mm.  I purchased them for $35 each as they are discontinued.   They are a pretty good EP especially with a long focal length scope.  I have consistently enjoyed very sharp high contrast images.   Eyepieces such as these are why some believe TVs are overpriced.   Don't get me wrong the Meade are not a TV EP, but for the money they do a great job.   Even at their original price ($89) they were a good buy, but at $35 they are a steal.   And though I don't own any, I have read the newer Meade HD are a fine EP.  Advancements in optical design, construction, coatings, etc have enabled manufacturers to produce excellent EPs at a much lower comparitive price.",0
"I have owned multiple Dobs. I did not say ""no"" to them. I say ""no"" currently to electronic eyepieces, because the good stuff is still expensive. The price may come down in the future. I said ""no"" to ED refractors, but the price came down there, and I bought two. In 1970 I was 14. I graduated to a 112mm reflector,965 focuser, alt-az mount. Way more aperture than anyone needed..",0
"In 1993 U.S. LP sales were about 300,000. In 2014 they were 9,200,000. In 2015 they were 12,000,000. The largest seller for 2015 was a Taylor Swift album (1989). You're right, I'm too old for her. I like Adele, and anything written before 1750.. My own habits are to purchase the CD if it's cheaper than the digital download. I then rip it. I find the 224 variable bit rate MP3s sold by Amazon to be fine for my system. LPs are something of a pain, though I have 200-300 of them from decades past, plus a decent turntable.. Swiss watch sales declined in 2015 for the first time since 2009. The biggest decline was in quartz movement watches. If you look at the data, much of the decline was due to the decline of the Chinese market. The Swiss cite economic circumstances and terrorism (especially in France), but frankly, the Chinese are eating their lunch. Chinese watch sales are booming, particularly the mechanical varieties. I might also add that Amazon (and others) is making a lot of these watches, along with Japanese domestic market watches easily available.. Pros and semi-pros use SLRs. Amateur astronomers may use SLRs. I use better quality super-zooms (the Panasonic FZ200), and good quality compacts (Canon G series). Casual snapping by people who don't know much about photography, but who would like to take a picture that looks OK on a screen, they tend to use cell phones. Low end cameras will likely become scarce. The SLR as status symbol will likely stay home.. ​Yes, but, but, 2017 is going to be the year of the Linux desktop! No, really!!.",0
"You missed my point. Cassettes never came back. LPs did. It's too soon to say what will happen with film. Electronic viewing might replace eyepieces, but people who speak confidently of its inevitability are perhaps a bit overconfident..",0

It is the same for Pentax, Docter, Nikon, EP's, or for APO refractors, or for handmade Dobsonians.. That just means that some people are ready to pay much more to get a bit more, cause yes, there are some feature better in high class EP's, all amateur astronomers are not bribed by big companies, nor snobbish, nor stupid.. But maybe I am stupid.. Warning : I love some TV lines, not all. So I'm not so stupid.",0
Great post! I never got that either. Human nature sure does seem to have an annoying evangelical side!  Definitely more than one way to enjoy this wonderful hobby.,0
"When some of u wrote electronic viewing, are u referring to a scope connected to a visual device such as a computer, notepad, etc?",0
"It's been used in a couple of contexts, NV and EAA. I'll let other folks who have wider experience than me provide input on NV. With EAA a high frame rate camera captures data and then displays it on a computer, small or large monitor or feeds a projector like the pico on an earlier link. Observing sessions can also be shared with others on various social feeds. The images are stacked and provide color to many of the brighter targets. Image integrations and camera speeds are close to real time in many instances. Great for outreach where you can display an image to many people at the same time and discuss what it is they are looking at. Setting up one scope projecting and one with an eyepiece to be honest I haven't noticed the public caring how they get to see the object. Contrary to some folks impressions the images from modern systems tend to be very sharp and color on something like M42 can be quite breathtaking. Glass or image both end up being processed by an optical train connected to an organic processor and both work perfectly well.. My favorite method of EAA is to feed a First Person View headset used to fly drones. Now that is like floating in space. It's a wireless feed and no mass of wires. Definitely one to try if you get the chance with Jupiter or Saturn as the target on a night of good seeing..",0
"Are TV overpriced? We have Galilean, Huygen, Ramsden, Kellner, Plossl, Abbe, Monocentric, Erfel, Konig, RKE, and Nagler lenses and probably some others. Each one of these designs were an improvement by the creator for what he was looking for. Each or any of these could be overpriced if it does not do what you are looking for. Each has a purpose, and each have different price points in their respective ranges. It really comes down to what can you see. In my own experience I tried a manufacturer that makes very nice eyepieces. Tried 3 different representative eyepieces in my scopes. Although the image was good, I see colour diffraction through these. (My eyes must be different) As a result this manufacturer's design philosophy although praised by many does not work for me. As a result overpriced for me, but a real deal for others. I wish I could be one of those who find them a deal. My view is look what others say, try yourself, if you find it appealing it's not overpriced if that is what it costs to make it.. To use the car analogy. A BMW or Toyota or Ford is a great car but if I need to haul a tonne of rock they are all overpriced, I really need a truck..",0
"I think electronic viewing has its place in amateur astronomy and it's certainly wonderful for outreach. However, for now at least, I strongly prefer visual astronomy with conventional eyepieces. I've gotten to try out Mallicams and Collins I3's a few times, and while they are very nice, I found the views they provide to be a bit too grainy and unnatural to suit me. I just enjoy the aesthetics of what I see through a conventional eyepiece, say a Televue (to stay on topic!), much better. Still, I am open-minded on this, and if the technology keeps improving, there is a very good chance I will add electronic viewing to my repertoire at some point..",0
Maybe a cheap eyepiece is still overpriced...,0
"Yes there's a lot to be said for both. I hope TeleVue have a fine future and keep pushing the envelope. Many of us are happy to pitch in to the R&D to the future generations of eyepieces.. Later next year check out the new CMOS based EAA. 16+ MPixel sure isn't grainy . An Open mind is a good thing, Astronomy isn't military academy as some folks would like to make it.. Might catch you on an online observing session one day..",0
"It seems to me that Televue (or any other top end eyepiece, pentax,takahashi, etc) is filling a high end niche similar to many other markets. Like most other markets, the trade-off between price and performance follows a bell curve, in which mid-range options give the greatest bang for your buck (and appeal to most consumers), and the extremes (cheap and expensive) offer less value. Take high end audio for example. You can buy a pair of mid-range speakers for $2,000 which will perform ~80% as well as the higher end $10,000 speakers. Are the $10,000 speakers ""worth"" it? Well, for some folks who have the money and want that extra 20% in performance, yes. But are they a better ""value""? Almost certainly not. I think the same general principle applies here. TV does not offer the best bang for your buck in terms of the price/performance scale, but many people find the extra expense ""worth it"" despite the lower value proposition. Also, many people also want to reward Televue for their R&D and contribution to the amateur astronomy market (which has value, although not in a traditional sense)..",0
"By today's standards, the I3 is a lower performing unit. Not surprising, given that it is what, 20 years old? All the specs have improved, and thin film is being replaced by no film.. As to cost - it depends upon perspective. Is it an eyepiece? Or is it an ""aperture doubler"". It's both, and more..",0
"So that means you're calling for a worldwide eyepiece boycot, right? Yes, we're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore. Finally, bring it on, an Astro-Revolution ! ! !.",0
"Depends on your perspective.. For me, TeleVue is the $2000 speakers, not the $10,000 ones.. And to keep the analogy up, in this case the $2000 speakers ARE the equal of the $10,000 ones..",0
"Where ever you want to peg the relative comparison, the point is the same. If TV eyepieces are the 2K speaker, then they are beat out by the $500 speaker that performs 50% as well as the $2,000 speaker. IE - Televue eyepieces are higher on the curve of diminishing returns than other eyepieces, in terms of performance per dollar. They do not represent the best value, but they clearly represent sufficient value for many to justify the cost.",0
It is a sad commentary on our entitlement society and educational system that so many people do not get the concept of the free market and voluntary value-for-value exchange..,0
"Maybe, Jeff, but sometimes the manufacturers and retailers take the concept too far and use marketing to get an exorbitant price for an item that is not worth it.  I'm not saying TV eyepieces are not worth the price, nor am I saying that they use marketing to any great degree as they don't need to and their quality speaks for itself, but whatever concept you want to believe in they are still expensive..........and that matters to those who want to obtain a TV eyepiece but find the price prohibitive.   Astronomy can be/is an expensive hobby depending on what level you want to take it to but let's face there is a lot of astronomy kit out there that is over priced.",0
"Film never LEFT for a lot of us!. I just bought some 4"" x 5"" for my Speed Graphic!!!",0
"They don't get the concept, or they don't agree with it? Plenty of people understand the notion that value is equal to what the market will bear, yet also disagree with that definition.",0
"Price is what you pay, value is what you get..",0
Right !.,0
"If Tele vue eyepieces were underpriced, no one would buy the bottom feeder brands..",0
Now there's a concept I can get myself wrapped around.,0
"Agree, it's a shame Astronomical companies are so few in number and don't have the leverage. If they did have that they could make terrible business decisions, over extend and basically fail bigly, pay no tax for 5 years and let the tax payer pick up the tab. Yup the not so free market. Sad. Heck Meade and Celestron might still be US owned if they could have got the same bailouts.",0
"Tele Vue has a sale on eyepieces once or twice each year. That is the time to buy. When purchased on sale, Tele Vue eyepieces, IMHO, are fairly priced given the high quality..",0
"LOL! It ain't the ""educational system"" you should worry about! It's the terrible students, who, academically, are well behind those of every other advanced industrial nation!!.",0
"Wow, where did all the young people bashing come from?.",0
It came from a sad commentary on our elitist society where people shame others for having a different point of view from their own..,0
"If people buy them, and many do, then they are worth it to them. Luxury products can demand a higher price at smaller sales volumes.. Free markets allow suppliers to set their prices (and corresponding supply quantities). Customers may desire certain products, but some may not seem worth the price, and those customers can chose to buy better value options.. My personal opinion is Televue sought higher than normal profit for their Ethos eyepieces, and that opened the floodgate for 100-120 AFOV competitors at lower prices. If Televue would have initially set their Ethos prices lower, they would have been able to keep this niche market; since competitors would have perceived less to gain if they entered that market..",0
"Televue does have the best quality, and may people pay lots of green for the green lettering. Others pay less for lower cost better value eyepieces from competitors..",0
"For whatever it's worth. I don't think Tele-Vue has huge margins. I think it's correspondingly more expensive to produce products in the zone of diminishing returns. They also probably put more work into fit and finish, which costs extra money and many people won't find necessary. Like anything else where one has to spend 50% more for the last 15% of performance, I don't think they make sense for everybody.",0
"Optically the Nagler T-6s are better in every way than the TMB Planetary eyepieces. And the 12mm, 16mm, 20mm Type 2 Naglers are superior optically in just about every way to the 16mm and Meade Series 5000 SWAs... And optically the 31mm Nagler has it all over the 32mm TeleVUe Wide field.. But there is more than optics and the TMB Planetary + Meade + TV WF do a good enough job and are much easier to manage. No 2 pound plus eyepieces, no trying to figure out it's the 7mm T-6 or the 5mm T-6.. My point was that tracking a Dob is not that big a deal with 60 degree AFoV eyepieces.. Or even 50 degree eyepieces. Jon.",0

"(Edited to be less needlessly inflammatory). I don't know if it's that. Millenials, which I identify with despite being on the older end of the group (35), face unique pressures that make astronomy harder and less rewarding. Pay is down and hours are up, so hobbies in general are kind of reduced in prominance. Also, light pollution increases the time commitment needed to stargaze, and many people just don't know it's even a thing because they've never seen a really good sky.",0
"I disagree. That's like saying everyone over 40 only star hops.[/quote]. I remember when I started in 2000 many old timers were dead set against goto setups.   They were especially hard on newbees.   They had a point about first learning the sky, but some were dead set against any type goto setup.  When I purchased my Orion 8"" intelliscope I was almost ashamed that I dared go with a push to setup.  Now, it is understood how goto's and other tech advancements help the hobby.  I'm glad I spent the better part of 2 years learning the sky without any other help but charts and star hoping.  But I really enjoy some of the advanced tech availabile.",0
A lot of folks do things the opposite way too. They get a goto mount and get started then get a dob to augment what they have and find their way around.. I tell a beginner if asked that they don't need to learn the Sky unless they want to. Computers make it optional now. Get out and enjoy and it's a less frustrating way to learn..,0

"Agree. The disdain I see from the older generation for younger generations on this board is somewhat incredible - and dare I say - rich. It is easy to look down your nose at a new generation - old timers have been doing it since timeimmemorial - but take a second to consider being raised in a time when you can see 10 stars in the sky and half the sky is blotted out by buildings. Then add in the fact that reaching decent skies requires a car (which limits you to people who can convince their parents to drive them or are over 16). Then add in the fact that the job market is far more competitive than it was in previous generations, the expectation of participation in copious numbers of extracurricular activities is up, parental trust of their kids to roam outside is down, the prospect of economic security is down (especially since our parents generation ran up the national debt and we don't think we will have social security when we retire), then add in the fact that children's parents are placing phones in their hands at 4 years old because they are easy and keep the child occupied. Then ask yourself: had I grown up in this environment, would I be interested in astronomy?. Maybe the older generation should look in the mirror at the actions they have taken - and the society they have left for their children - before criticizing them as somehow inherently lazy or uninterested. Note: I am not pointing these comments specifically to the above poster - but more generally to the sentiment which I see all too frequently..",0
"Well, dgoldb, don't let your irritation let you fall into the same trap by pointing fingers at the older generation because of people who point fingers at the younger generation........which achieves nothing.  I'm of the older generation and don't take blame for the state of the coffers of my country, the changing technology leading to a change in culture and society, or for Climate Warming, nor do I think that the younger generation is either lazy or uninterested in their own or the world's future The older generation was no different to the present generation, we had the same problems, the same desires, the outlooks relevant to the times they were in, etc so don't let other people's possible narrow view of Life make your finger point in the wrong direction. So, getting the thread back on track, I think Televue ep's are expensive but the quality does make up for that, I guess.  We all have to watch our wallets and perhaps delay getting the ep that we most desire, but when we finally do get it there is that glow of achievement and satisfaction that makes it all worth while.  Young or old, there are a lot of amateur astronomers who struggle to find the money to get the best they can so that they can do what they like best.........staring at the Stars.",0
"If your Dob is set up right, it shouldn't be an issue going from a 6oz eyepiece to a 2 pound eyepiece. If you're just observing by yourself or maybe one other person, I can understand that 50 or 60 degree eyepieces are okay for you even though this is almost 2017 after all. I hated that ""looking-down-a-tunnel"" viewing back in the day. I want to minimize placing anything between me and outer space, that includes eyepieces. An ""engaging"", ""immersive"" eyepiece is not a 55 or 60-degree eyepiece, it's an eyepiece that tends to just get out of the way, so that you almost don't even know it's there! And a wide field of view (among other things) really helps in that department. For planetary viewing, it doesn't matter that much but, for deep-sky, a 70+ degree wide field is an essential part of observing enjoyment in my opinion. And when it comes to outreach, I demand (of myself) that I show people the best possible views, so they can get the most enjoyment. Toward that end, I avoid eyepieces that have kidney-beaning, short eye relief, tunnel-vision or other problems. I also like the fact that, with an 82-degree eyepiece, two or three people can go up and down the ladder before I have to break the continuity of things by moving the scope. So call me opinionated but, when it comes to deep-sky, whether just for me or in conjunction with public viewing, 70-degree-plus eyepieces are simply a much better all-around experience..",0
"The point was not to point fingers but rather to encourage people to look in the mirror before blaming others. My generation certainly has short comings, as does the previous.

"Well, I'm no Wise Man, dgoldb, but I have learnt that most people who criticise other people or generations usually don't like to, or won't, look into ""the mirror"" to see their own faults and short falling's   I doubt if there is any generation or person that hasn't, or doesn't, lived in a ""Glass House"" of some kind.

"It's true about the wide view versus the normal 50 degree FOV.   If ur a planet person wide view is not as important as transmission, contrast, sharpness etc. That is why I have various plossls on the same FL.  I have 3 TV Plossls and a TV 3x Barlow.   I prob started off the debate per this thread when I wrote that my TV plossls are not so much better than my other brands.   For instance my Meade series 4000 and even my Orion Serius plossls give them a run for their money.   And the Meade and Orion plossls are about 1/2 or even 1/3 the cost.    With that logic I said I felt the TV plossls were overpriced.",0

I am willing to pay a premium as there is a company behind these eyepieces, humans that answer the phoneor email that know what they are talking about or will get me to one that does, even theowner, no matter if I bought full price from them or not... no complaints about price or value on my part..

"""Are Televue eyepieces overpriced?"". Of course they are--but it appears that they are the best thing since slice bread!. Until some body comes out with a better mouse trap!. In every field (of interest) the same phenomenon happens!. I ""observe"" a similar phenomenon in cycling gears, photography and of course audiophile!. Competition and marketing is what is all about!.",0
"I have purchased 3 TV plossls; my most recent purchase the 8mm a yr ago.  I understand the a person can and often purchases an eyepiece even if the cost appears excessive.   But that doesn't mean the EP is not overpriced.  Here is what I think:  to decide if an EP is overpriced u would have to establish a baseline.  What constitutes an average price in that category.  Since I was only commenting on plossls I would submit that good plossls can be purchased for $35 each.  This is a bit more the the price of the Meade 4000, and other name brands such as Celestron's Omni series and Orion's Sirius plossls.  Those are all good performers.. My experience has led me to believe the Orion Sirius line is a bit better in the short FLs.  For instance, the 6.3 and 7.5mm EPs are really nice and provide top notch views.  I have found the Meade 4000 excels in the mid ranges.  It's 12.4, 15, 20, and 26mm are all very good EPs.  The 26 is a very nice and versatile EP and provides nice views alone or when used with several of my barlows.   I really like the 15 and 20.  Now, my 8mm TV is a fine EP, but it has a limited FOV and a very tight eyerelief.  It is not noticeable better then the Orion 7.5.   In direct comparison with the Meade 4000, I have not found the TV 15mm plossl to be visually superior.   I believe the TV 11mm is a top planetary EP.  It consistently provides better views than any other plossl EP close to its focal length.   Since the competitive EPs provide substantially the same view as the TVs with the exception of the 11mm,  one has to look at the price of the TV plossls. They usually cost $90 to $100 each or nearly 200% more than the competition.   Since the views provided are very similar it is hard to miss the conclusion concerning plossls only: TV plossls are overpriced.  Using this criteria it didn't matter if TV outsells the other brands.  Just because people ignore the stats does not make the stats meaningless.  If a competitors EP can provide a similar view at 1/2 or less the price, then your EP has to be overpriced.  You might overcome that problem with clever marketing, but even if you do, your eyepieces is still overpriced.",0
"It depends on materials used and quality of construction as well, not just the performance. If this was the case, one would say that a Porsche is overpriced when compared to a Toyota Supra - let's say both having equivalent acceleration and horsepower. Look, this horse is long dead. We live in a consumer orient d society. What one person finds overpriced, someone else may consider inexpensive. There is no baseline.",0
The only thing overpriced (at least on the Delites) are the incredibly poor fitting eyepiece caps on both top and bottom.. Eric.,0
"I have to disagree.  We are comparing very similar products.  Not only eyepieces, but specific types of eyepieces: plossls.  The Meade 4000 are particularly well made.  They use the same type of glass,  coatings, and general  construction.   These are not horses and cars, not Fords compared to BMWs with similar engines.   These are very similar eyepieces that are well made and provide similar images.  When you write TVs are better in terms such as materials and construction you are in essence making my point.  There is no proof that the materials or construction of the TV plossl is better than that of a Meade 4000.   By what standard?   Does the TV last longer?  Does it have a nicer appeal?   I have owned several of both lines and the biggest advantge of the TV is that it's info is engraved into the housing while the Meade is painted.  After much use the Meade tends to wear off.   In my opinion, hardly worth a doubling in price.",0
"Eric,. Your comment is spot on. Unfortunately, this extends to the entire range..",0
"Lenny,. It's the age old discussion of Japanese Vs Chinese Vs Taiwanese. Labor costs in some markets cost more. QC costs more. Also, there is a guy working at TV who does QC on every single eyepiece. So, everything gets shipped to TV, then gets checked, then gets shipped out again. Furthermore, TV continues doing R&D which then other companies simply copy.. All the above COST MONEY. Money that is then added to the price of an eyepiece. Whether one chooses to support the above working ethos / business practice is a personal matter.Others have of course disseminated the designs of Tele Vue and produced similar products. This has long been discussed and let's not get involved in the ethics of this, but my own personal preference (emphasis on own personal) is for me to support the people doing the R&D i.e. Tele Vue. Not only that, but I love the fact that I can call Tele Vue and get uncle Al on the line.. Each of has their own choice to make when buying an eyepiece. Each of us has their own criteria. This topic really is asking something that is of a personal nature and cannot truly be quantified. Me, I'll choose Tele Vue over any other eyepiece for the above mentioned reasons. Call me silly if you want, I don't mind. I would rather save a bit more and get something to which I can then feel a personal connection as it relates to my own values in life.. de gustibus non est disputandum....",0
"I will add to this topic some personal information. I am an auditor and have also worked in the industry as a CFO for 8 years - total 21 years experience in the field of accounting, auditing, finance and business development.. I have done business plans / feasibility studies / product costing e.t.c. to such an extend that I can tell you that most people posting here are posting based on their own personal experience, not from business knowledge of the industry - or any industry for that matter.. These are the prices that Tele Vue charges. They also have about twice a year a sale. There is also the pre-owned market. Lot's of choices. Buy 'em if you want, don't buy them if you don't. But calling them overpriced without knowing the price structure behind the product is an unsupported assertion.. Calling them overpriced Vs another similar product is another story if one ignores R&D, QC, material cost and after sales support. IF ONE WERE TO IGNORE the 4 parameters I list, then go ahead and call them overpriced..",0
"We can discus business ethics if you prefer, but that was not the original question.  If one wishes to support TVs R & D etc is a personal decision.   But, if you take the conversation in that direction it's hard to say where it will end up.  So, I am only answering the original question, are TVs overpriced?   For whatever reason; R and D, qualify control,  the answer is yes.",0
"Based on your own criteria and ignoring R&D, QC and other factors, then yes. Based on my own criteria, no.. But that's the beauty of it. We can agree to disagree in a civilized matter",0
Ok. Sounds good to me.,0
"Okay, so Tele Vue Plossls cost twice as much (actually about 2.5x as much) as Meade Plossls. I'd be willing to bet that, for the most part, the person who chooses Tele Vue Plossls over Meade Plossls does so because they just can't stand the feeling of looking through a Meade and wondering if they're actually seeing every detail or not. The Tele Vue purchaser has no doubt at all...every detail IS right there in the eyepiece...nothing is missing! For a huge number of observers, any eyepiece that can provide that kind of confidence is...PRICELESS!.",0
"I would agree and here comes a term that Lenny used a while ago. Goodwill.. Although goodwill is something that arises from the purchase of a business typically (difference between price paid and net book value of separable net assets), in this case let's call it the premium one is willing to pay to buy a product where expectations are that performance will be top notch and there will be few if any product quality problems.. That in itself has a certain value attributed to it, a premium which is added to the price of the product....",0
"Am I the only one who doesn't find much remarkable about Tele-Vue plossls? I have one I got with a used scope I bought, and I'm pretty sure I could not differentiate it from a regular high quality plossl.",0
"Of all the TV eyepieces to talk about, some detractors' apparent obsession with Plossls is amusing in a ridiculous way.  Theyarelegacy eyepieces introduced at the start of the company to establish their credibility as a producer of high quality eyepieces so that they could introduce what they were really planning. The most recent TV Plossl has to be around two decades old and was part of the replacement set for the mid to short focal length range.. Ask yourself why do they keep selling them? For the margins? I doubt it. For the prestige of making a standard field eyepiece? Probably not... So why?. They make them because people still want them and are willing to pay Tele Vue's price, including QC, support, and continuing R&D (even if the R&D isn't spent on Plossls.) ObviouslyTV Plossl'sare NOT yet overpriced because they remain in demand. Why do we still want them? There are a lot of answers for that and each has his/her own reasons. For me it is a combination of the price not being particularly high--esp. when on sale--as well as being a reliable standard. No hassle piece of mind.. ES doesn't makePlossls do they? I wonder why... Because folks aren't demanding ES Plossl's? There would be no margin left after the set up, QC, support for the expected discount? (There is a lot of discount competition for Plossls.) Perhaps because there is no history/legacy requiring them to be in the Plossl market? Or...taking an actualwell-deserved cheap shot at ES...maybe they are too old of a TV design to copy?",0
"Yep, it bears repeating that based on Tele Vue history, the Plossls were introduced in their reworked form by Al Nagler in order for people to familiarize themselves with a new company.. He actually had to wait for the company's reputation to be established to actually come out commercially with the Naglers - a design he kept ""in the closet"" for some time until he felt that the market was ready for the Nagler eyepiece revolution of 82 degrees AFOV..",0
"I have indeed read Al's interview where he has stated this. But it has made me wonder.. The usual business mantra for a new product entry into an existing market is either to make it significantly better or significantly cheaper. By most accounts expressed above, TV plossls appear to be neither compared to the current offerings (iesome state the TV plossls performance is not really better, some state its the workmanship thats the divide, yet others feel its the peace of mind (- better to not see it but know you have it rather than not see it and wonder if you have it). So, to those who were around when TV plossls were first introduced - would you please comment if you felt the TV plossls were significantly better than what was offered then?. Thanks!.",0
"Hi eklf,. A fair question!. From our sponsor's website- a bit of history on the Plossls. Apparently Nagler & Co improved a lot on the original design and therefore the product was deemed to be significantly better.. Remember, we are chatting about the history of the plossls when they were first introduced in their new design by Al Nagler (early 80's, so about 30 or so years ago) - not about current offering although their 32mm Plossl is the best I have tried (comparing to other current offerings of plossls)..",0
"""Significantly"" better when they were introduced? Absolutely! I made an earlier post in this thread that went into detail. The short story is that Tele Vue Plossls, particularly the 26mm, simply retired my other brand name Plossls...just flat put them out to pasture! Why? It might have been the highly polished lenses with superb overall optical quality or the better optical design with a wider field of view or the blackened lens edges for better contrast or the good baffling or the superior coatings or the quality workmanship including engraved lettering or that ""Made in Japan"" ingredient. The extra heft and robustness even made them feel much better in your hand than all the others. In fact, all of those things at that particular point in time combined to put Tele Vue Plossls in A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN..",0
"Televue Plossls and University Optics HD orthos are both about $100, but everyone praises HD orthos about what good value they are compared to very expensive planetary eyepieces. The entire line of Televue Plossls are excellent, but that cannot be said for GSO. There's a reason GSO, Orion Sirius, and even Celestron Silvertops are sold off or in my B case..",0
"TeleVues are not overpriced, I'm just underfunded..",0
"A good many have made the statement that TV plossls are better than....... however, I own many different plossls including several TVs and have made a lot of comparisons.   I don't see any significant different between many or the competitors brands and TV concerning performance and construction.   But I'm not going to beat a dead horse.  If u want to pay more for the same..... ok by me.",0
"Well, the ubiquitous inexpensive Chinese Plossl didn't exist then.. I had a set of Clave Plossls but they were considered ""exotic"" at the time I bought them, but they weren't common where I observed with others.. And the TeleVues were less expensive.. When TeleVue came out with theirs, I thought they were noticeably better corrected at the edges of the field. I didn't notice the inherent vignetting or any other issues common on those first Plossls from TV.. I replaced my TeleVues (which are different than the ones available now, both in optical configuration and coatings) with the 5-element Meade Series 4000 ""Super Plossl"" (made by Kowa in Japan) many years later because I found them brighter and equally well-made. And those weren't the last 50° eyepieces I bought. Almost everything since has been wider. (Actually, I had mixed apparent fields all the way to 82° starting in the early '80s).. So the price comparisons people make now weren't comparisons you could make back then. There weren't ANY Chinese eyepieces when TeleVue introduced their Plossls..",0
"I think you are missing my point. You originally commented;. ""Can you imagine pushing a Dobsonian around the sky today using only 55 to 60-degree FOV eyepieces? You would probably spend more time moving the scope than observing."". I was only trying share my experiences as someone who owns a set of Naglers from 31mm to 3.5mm augmented by the 41mm, 35mm and 22 mm Panoptic and a setup of 60 degree TMB Planetary eyepieces and various Plossls.. My point:. Tracking with 50-60 degree eyepieces is not an issue... The 4mm TMB without the Paracorr provides 312x with the 2x Barlow, it's about 625x. My 10 inch F/5 tracks nicely, I don't have a problem. My scopes are setup to balance with all my eyepieces, that's not the issue. With the 10 inch, it has eye piece racks, the 60 degree AFOV eyepieces all fit side by side, the larger Naglers do not. And yes, under dark skies, its the Naglers and Panoptics. On my big scope, the ladder has a tray with a rack that's setup to handle them..",0
"Oh, I think it is much too late for you to say that. You've been persistent in beating that dead horse for a dozen pages or so..",0
"Lenny:. Whether or not the TeleVue Plossls are overpriced, they are atypical in terms of TeleVue eyepieces. They were designed more than 35 years ago to introduce the then unknown TeleVue to the eyepiece market. At the time they were well received and paved the way for revolutionary eyepieces that established TeleVue as the major innovator in astronomical eyepieces. In my view, this thread should focus on the eyepieces that set TeleVue apart, that they are known for, the Naglers, the Panoptics, the Ethos's, the Delos's, the Delites as well as the older Radians. These are the TeleVue eyepieces that are very much in the TeleVue vision and tradition. Whether or not the TeleVue Plossls are over priced, it's a side issue in my book. But I will say this: In 1996, Sky and Telescope did a serious review of Plossl and Plossl like eyepieces. The major players were all there, the Celestron Ultimas, the GSO Celestrons, the Meade 3000 and 4000 series, the Sirius Plossls and several others were tested and evaluated. The two sets that they considered to provide the best views were the TeleVue Plossls and the Celestron Ultimas. At each focal length, the Ultimas were $2 more than the TeleVues... When one considers the Naglers, etc, they are the standard, they were there first and others, like it not, copied the TeleVue designs. As I said previously, at this level, eyepieces like these are not commodities.... Jon.",0
"I believe there was a similar review in Astronomy a year or so earlier that led me to the same conclusion. That was why I went with TeleVue Plossls when configuring my first scope in 1995. At the time I didn't see myself going the Nagler route and didn't see how they could be worth the cost. When I finally tried a 9mm Nagler it blew me away.. Back in the early 90's I remember readingan article discussingthe JD Powers initial quality survey results of models of Japanese made vehicles that were rebadged as domestic US. These were the same cars madein the same plant. Yet the survey results were far different and the Japanesebadged version got much poorer marks. Why? The consumer was different. Those buying the Japanese badged car were more critical of flaws, while those buying domestically badged vehicles accepted them.. Some yearsafter the car article I had a discussion with another engineer who was proposing that there was no real difference in Japanese and domestic quality at the timeand therefore no justification for a higher price. To me reliability is one of the most important criteria invehicle selection. After pointing out that I had all sorts of trouble with reliability of the domestic brands (stranded by break downs)and the Japanese vehicles Iowned hadbeen reliable with no major failures, I asked him, ""Jim, how many transmissions have you put in that Suburban in the 100,000 (or something like that) miles you have owned it?"" He had put in two at that point. Game, set, match..",0
"There was no China anything back in them days thank God. I love the older Tele vue stuff the most and have most of first run Circle NJ Plossls, Naglers and Wide fields. I always said that Tele Vue did the most for the hobby as eyepiece tech was dead around 1980. The first Naglers were the biggest game changer in my book..",0
I was overly optimistic.   Lol.,0
"Really, how much more can be said in this thread? I was going to post this and of all the people it's Lenny who mentions beating a dead horse.   Sorry you didn't like the TV Plossls but how many times did it need to be articulated?",0

"It seems then that the consensus is that TV eyepieces are indeed overpriced and that most people here have acquired them either on the used market or on their annual sale events..... Now that we have established that, we can finally close this thread and start a new one on Are ES eyepieces are indeed underpriced...... Here are some of my overpriced eyepieces.......",0
I had a similar experience while extensively comparing a Tele Vue 26mm Plossl to a Meade 25mm 3000 series Plossl. While the Meade was pretty to look at - great looking shiny finish - it did not control scatter as well as the Tele Vue. That Tele Vue is still one of the most ergonomically comfortable eyepieces residing in the stable..,0
"I dunno, I picked up all of my early TV kit new15 - 21 year ago before there were any sales that I can recall. It has only been in the last year when I needed to change my kit to match new viewing conditions (and some gear upgrades)that I even became aware of the sales andby then I had already bought half of what I needed.. The ES eyepieces are underpriced when they are on their deep sales. That is when I picked several up for my son's scope. The rest of the time they are probably more rationally priced, but why would I pay full price when I know there will be abig sale later? What surprises me is that Ioften see them listed used forconsiderably more than I paid for them new.Considering the mainland China connection/subsidiary status and TV already having developed the basic designs that formed the core ofES's eyepiece offerings, it isn't surprising that they can undersell competitors bysuch a large margin..",0

"I can vouch for this from personal experience. I bought a William Optics SWAN 20mm with a claimed 72* afov secondhand for AUD58. Well, it is unusable in a fast dob with only on axis ever being in focus. The outer half of the view is opaque. Don't worry about CA, astigmatism, pincushion any of that - its opaque!. it is overpriced at 5 cents!.",0
Wow! What a photo!. but this time I'm only half jealous.,0
"I like that one.   No doubt, if an eyepiece is really bad they are not worth the packing paper in which they were shipped.   I have a few bombs...... that never see use.  They r so bad I couldn't bring myself to sell them.. In the past, i have  scavengerized junkers; trading barrels or eye cups when needed with a useable EP.    I once used the eyelens of an unused eyepiece to replace a broken eyelens in an eyepiece I often used.  The broken eyelens made the decent eyepiece unusable so I didn't have anything much to lose.   However, it wasn't an apple for apple trade.  The result was OK, but I obviously changed the focal length, FOV, and eyerelief.",0
"Hi Lenny,. Yeah, I've kept this dud. Not right to try and shift it on to someone else.. Here is the bright side though, the utility of this eyepiece is no worse even when the sky is completely overcast! No? It was worth a try..... p.s. Well done for making some use of it. You've given me an idea. Time to dissect!",0
It would make an excellent paper weight as well!.,0
"Its funny to me these arguments about if something is overpriced thats better and just about $100 dollars more. lets look at some facts:. naglers t6 $309 new and $200 used. es 82 $150 new and $100 used. meade 82 $129 new and $100 used. ethos $600 new and $450 used. es 100 $400 new and used $300. delos $340 new and $250 used. Pentax xw $329 new $230 used. Baader morph $240 new and $200. looking at these examples i would not say the TV products are overpriced just getting a better product for a bit more money. perspective:. -comparing to other items say a car people are will to spend $1000s or $10,000s more just because of a feature or two but still gets you from point a to point b. -credit card payments people are willing to max out and have large intrest accumulate and pay extra money for buying things up front instead of waiting and buying when you can afford it. -mortgage/house people dont mind paying minimal to the bank upfront but willing to pay more intrest over a long period of time loosing $1000s. so when talking $100s extra coin here and there its funny. not looking at the big picture and penny pinching. Fact if you give a few calls to your credit card company,Bank,Insurance company etc you could own a set of TV eyepieces for free",0
"Being in Canada I've only bought TV eyepieces new when the Canadian Dollar was par with the US Dollar a few years ago...and even then I bought half of them used. Nowadays with a 30-35% currency difference I just buy used...mostly... They're still worth every penny though, new or used.",0

I have over 20 TV s all 1.25 inch.. They are quality eps no denying it. The Plossl. Sare excellent for planetary and the panoptic, Nagler range work really well in fast scopes.. Yes the prices are a bit steep. Mr Nagler and his Whanau must be pretty wealthy, good on them.. They dominate the market......for good reason as their business model and quality control is from my experience pretty impressive..",0
Brandon?.,0
"I don't think Ethos / Delos / Delites are overpriced. They are unique in their own and they are the last product that TV has made.. To me, the Nagler line is overpriced given their design. It was innovative, but is it still now?. Said this, sellers have the right to sell their items at the price they want. It's up to buyers to decide whether that is worth or not. I would not buy a new Nagler eyepiece, as it seems to me that I would pay for an heritage rather than for pure innovation. That's just me and using my medium-slow telescopes though..",0
"The Naglers are still excellent eyepieces that unmatched as 82 degree eyepieces. Their only competition of similar quality are other TeleVue eyepieces.. And the 31mm Nagler, what can one say?. The consensus I have seen is that they are expensive but they are well made and stand above the competition. Whether one buys one new or used.. that has little relevance. I buy my cars used but that doesn't not make a new car overpriced because from my point of view, it just doesn't wash. Buy a used car that has at least half it's useful life left or less than a quarter of it's new price. As long as that equation holds true (it may not hold true in other locations and climate), a used car is the solution.. And think of it.. Buy a car for $30,000. In 10 years it might be worth $3,000.  Just how expensive is a $600 eyepiece? Put one and one together. Buy used cars, buy expensive eyepieces new or used, they last forever.. Jon.",0

"Seriously $26K is not an expensive lavish car. It also saves money over time in fuel costs. When you look at the average income for a Honda Accord owner being in the mid $50k's, the demographic example isn't of big spenders..",0
"The cheapest new car in the US market this year is $12885.. This article explains that the typical new car is too expensive for the average family:. http://www.nytimes.c...finds.html?_r=0. $16K buys a pretty good 5 year old car, but doesn't buy much of a new car.. I drove a Nissan Versa Note in Canada, and a friend asked me about it and I said I thought it was a pretty good economy car.. He priced out the car I drove, with the features I had in my rental, and it was close to $24K. It is a good example of where prices of new cars have gone.. In the past year, I've rented a Prius, an Elantra, a Versa Note, a Mini Cooper, and a Dodge Caravan.. The Prius was by far the cheapest interior, poorest handling, most underpowered car in the bunch.. So I agree it's a bit expensive for what it is, but the choice of a Prius does indicate that the car is not a status symbol nor chosen for its driving ability.. To those of us for whom driving is one of the things we like to do, the Prius is sort of an ""anti-status"" icon, an ETA (economy transportation appliance).. It definitely lives up to the idea of an economical car. I had no trouble getting 50mpg in one.. As you say, it is a matter of perspective. But the Prius does not say you have wealth or that you value the status of an expensive car.. It's about the same price as a new Honda Accord, and having one of those is certainly not a sign of wealth.. A BMW i8, on the other hand.......(and there are 2 of them on my street!). Of course, Howard Hughes wore ready-made suits and didn't spend lavishly, so a car might be a poor example of wealth.. Wealth is not always ostentatiously displayed.. So perhaps my example wasn't particularly a good one.. Point taken, Dave..",0
"Again, if new cars are overpriced, why are there so many on the road?",0
Well I'm glad for you guys that $26000 is not an expensive car. I bought a brand new 2015 Kia Optima at a local dealership for $16000 last year. It gets 32 mpg on the highway. Not as good gas mileage as the Prius but pretty good for a mid-size sedan and a much more practical car for my family. This year I bought my wife a 2013 VW Passat with 32000 miles for $12900 at the same dealership.  That is two quality mid-sized sedans for just $3000 more than a single hybrid Prius.. Each person has the own definition of what is inexpensive.,0
And it's the most reliable car on the road..,0
"We've had one of the older Prius' since 2008. Price was good compared to similar reliable vehicles.. Cost of maintaining it has been the lowest of any car I've every had. Savings on gasoline, tires and brakes have been substantial. Approaching 120,000 miles and no brake jobs...and none forecast. The last set of tires lasted over 70,000 miles...I have typically gotten 35,000-40,000 maxout of a set of 4 on other vehicles.. Ours handles well because I made a few small suspension upgrades early on--strut tower brace and rear stiffening plate (about $300 dollars total from what I recall.) Nothing unusual about that as I tend to make similar upgrades on other vehicles depending on what is needed..",0

"OK folks back to the actual subject, which is if you will pause to remember, ARE TELEVUE EYEPIECES OVERPRICED? Well, here's a relevant story. OK, stop reading if you have never made a stupid mistake putting an expensive object in a really bad place. Back in August I was solar imaging on my balcony with my Coronado 90. I carelessly put my 24 Panoptic on the railing. Then I whacked it with my elbow, and it silently followed the rules of gravity and trajectory through a 25 FOOT drop onto solid concrete. Those seconds were agony. Then the WHACK of impact, and a horrible tumbling racket as it coursed downhill to the middle of the street. Shell shocked, I wandered down expecting to see a grotesque array of shattered exotic glass bits.. but no. No. The eyepiece, and attached filter, were intact. Just a couple tiny indentations. Otherwise fine. Was it optically affected? Not in the least. No rattles. It's fine. So, besides the viewing quality, you are getting first rate mechanicals as well, which does cost a few pennies of factory cost..",0
"Glad it worked out for you, but I would call that Luck.. Of course, you could test my Null Hypothesis and get back to us with the results:. 1) Line up all of your Tele Vue eyepieces on that ledge.. 2) Push them over one at a time.. 3) If it was Engineering, then they will all be fine..",0
"I've owned 11mm and 17mm Tele Vue Plossls. They're good, but I think they're overpriced. I can't tell much difference between those and other Plossls in my low end scopes. For the same money, I think KK Fujiyama Orthos are a better deal than Tele Vue Plossls. The Orthos have more eye relief too..",0
"What I've spent on EP's over the years I should have just purchased Televue from the start. Once I got my 20"" Obsession there was no reason to use less expensive EP's. It's like putting cheap tires on a Ferrari and expecting it to corner.. JJ.",0
"Could you have actually afforded Televue at the start? I know that when I started, $50 for a plossl was very difficult for me to raise, and $300 for a Nagler or something would have been hilariously impossible (it would have cost significantly more than my first telescopes). Even now for me buying something like a Delos or ES100 is a big deal, requiring substantial thought and some effort, and I still can't wrap my mind around spending Ethos money (although I technically could).. Another issue with 'I wish I would have bought once' is this - It's not like Tele-Vue doesn't update and improve their product! Most people who are saying that in this thread started pre-Ethos and pre-Delos and likely would have wanted to upgrade anyway when those lines were released. Some of them even started before many of the current Naglers were out!.",0
"Ok.  It seems this thread is coming full circle; it just will not die. I'm not sure what that means. At any rate, I have come to the same conclusion as you, with several of my name plossls.  But u will find that many who responded on the thread believe the TV plossls and in fact all TV eyepieces have a certain intrinsic value. Even if appears your are paying more than you should, you are in fact getting a great deal. Either it's the manufacturing that is better, or the company, or the feel, or performance, and on and on, but for whatever reason no matter what you believe you have observed, TV eyepieces are not overpriced.  You might as well give up now.",0
"My comment is only about the Tele Vue Plossl eyepieces. I think at $100 a pop, there many other choices available besides a simple Plossl. I've never used other TV eyepieces like the Radian, Delite, Nagler or Ethos, so I can't comment on those.. Here is an example. A TV Plossl 25mm with 50 degrees AFOV costs $109.50. But, I saw an Explorer Scientific 24mm 68 degree eyepiece on sale for $103.99. The Explorer Scientific eyepiece appears to give more bang for 100 bucks..",0
Exactly my sentiments.    Just what I wrote last week.   Amazing...... lol.,0
"I suspect your hypothesis is wrong for at least half of us based on responses I have seen. I haven't had the urge to go to 100 degree eyepieces andthat is often an area where people stop because they don't believe they will find the extra field useful. I don't want or need the eye relief of the Delos. Neither have been on my shopping list.. While I started before many (any?) of the current Naglers were out (just T1's and T2's at the time) I have not discontinued use of my T1 Naglers or Panoptics or my longer focal length Plossls. With respect totheNaglers/Panoptics not much new has emerged since I ordered byObsession in 2003 except for the 3-6 zoom and the 41 Panoptic (the latter isn't really even a match for this scope.) If I commission a much larger scope with smaller field of view, then I will likely add some Ethos to the mix because of the particular focal length and ratio that would be employed. But as it is I am satisfied with the field of Naglers or the longer focal length Panoptics or even Plossls depending on the application.. So I don't think your assumption that folks will be seeking toemploy the latest and greatest ofeverythingTV offersis sound at all..",0
"""Expensive"" is not the same thing as ""overpriced."" And, for a good quality new car, $26,000 is not expensive (or overpriced). The mere fact that you cannot afford it does not make it expensive (or overpriced); it merely means that you cannot afford it. Some people cannot afford a simple meal; again, that does not mean that that meal is expensive, only that they cannot afford it.Likewise for high quality optical equipment.. Mark.",0
"And to add to Mark's point, the idea you cannot afford something is often based on one's priorities.. When I worked for $60 a week, I owned a $350 bicycle because that was a priority over a newer pair of shoes or a nice winter coat.. I had to save for over a year to buy it.. I used to see guys with a $400 car pull up at the bike shop with a $4500 bike hung on the bike rack.. It's usually about one's priorities.. And there is nothing wrong with that--one's children should take precedence over a new eyepiece.. Frankly, I don't know how many young families can afford to eat, let alone buy a new eyepiece with discretionary money.. At some point in your life, hopefully, the kids are gone, the house is paid for, the cars are paid for and still running fine, and you have money left over after all the bills are paid..",0
"Please re read the red bits of sig. Oh ,and the 1980's rang ,they said can they have their joke back",0
Yes please do.,0
"Not very much economics in this thread. From TV's prospective, the question of whether something is ""overpriced"" is really whether TV has priced their EPs to maximize their profit - which is something we can't know. Obviously, lowering their prices will increase demand, but decrease margins. It may well be that TV would be more profitable with lower margins, but who knows. Too many unknown variables. The only thing we can say as outsiders is thatfor us,the EP is not worth the price ask (or, that it is). That doesn't really mean something is overpriced in a traditional sense though. Lots of products are too expensive for segments of the market too justify, but they are priced appropriately to maximize profit in a given niche.",0
"Pretty much sums it up. Different products are made for a specific segment of the market. Demographics play a big part, I would assume a consumer who buys for example a large 20"" plus Obsession fast dob is more the target market than someone with an Achro with poor correction and a boat load of CA. The caviar tastes but fish and chips budget paradox.. The question to ask is are they too expensive if your in the targeted market segment?.",0
"My sense is that TV is probably most threatened within its own market segment by clones, which come darn close to matching their quality (im thinking ES namely). If ES can offer essentially matched performance, then TV is relying on good will and name recognition alone, which won't last in the long run. For now, they seem to have just enough of an edge on ES for a significant portion of the upper portion of the market to still justify the cost. Not clear that will hold up long term though.",0
"I'll write it again:. Tele Vue eyepieces are on sale once or twice each year, at 10-20% off. That is the time to buy. At 20% off, Tele Vue eyepieces are certainly not overpriced.. Bill.",0
"Just for fun, let's assume TeleVue has a huge profit margin (which is not the case with most mfgrs)....Why would they not reduce the prices and drive everyone else out of business?  Lets face it, if you could get the TeleVue for the same price as an ES...you'd see green and black eyepieces only in people's kits. Its not the eyepieces that costs....its the R&D that went into it.....anyone can copy something, not everyone can design one from scratch..",0
But TV get the buffer from their R&D. None of the clone makers have copied the Delos or Delites yet. That segment of the market TV still own for now..,0
"Actually, we did discus some economic issues such as goodwill, established price, etc..... But to decide if TVs are overpriced u would simply come up with a normal price range. That is easy.  TV cost more than any other plossls on the market. Their lowest price is a about $95. (Probably an average price per plossl is somewhere about $35 to $50.)  That would be ok if they were better than the other eyepiece. But by my observations they were not obviously superior. However they did seem better made and came with great customer support. I limited my comments to the TV plossls since they were the TVs I own and I can also make direct comparison with other plosssl. Given those paramaters I think one could reasonably come to a conclusion.",0
"It isn't as easy as simply cutting prices and selling more. Ramping up sales is not easy. There are challenges with ramping up production while maintaining QC standards, distribution channels, sourcing of materials, lines of credit, etc. TV has chosen to keep itself relatively small, which keeps logistical issues (relatively) easier to manage. And as to their costs, I suspect you have no idea what their costs are.  I see no reason to believe that R&D costs are that high for TV. Sounds like pure speculation to me.",0
"Televue want to be in the Luxury market. If they would have initially had lower Ethos prices they could have kept that niche market all for themselves. But with setting above Ethos and prevented competitors from entering for 7 years, but they chose not to do so..",0
"You know, this thread really reminds me of my compatriots, most of whom are obsessed with football.Suddenly, everybody sitting in front of the TV, is the best referee, would have scored 17 goals if they were playing and they would have done a far better job as a coach.And then in real life, someone else has to do the hard job. It's easy to judge and say that TV is overpriced and they should have done this and that. Judging comes easy unfortunately - it's human nature.However, the way I see it, moving from theory to practice is always a challenge. And Tele Vue has selected a particular model of operations and a certain price structure, quality control, country of manufacture, product design quality e.t.c.""They"" have done it and ""we"" are sitting in front of the TV judging. With only partial information. With no access to pricing structure. Without knowing why Al Nagler chooses to operate his company as he is. Without knowing what effort, manhours and money go into R&D. For a lot of us, without knowing how to set up a company, run it and try to make a living out of it as opposed to being a salaried employee, working fixed hours a day and receiving a pay check...So, after quite a large number of posts, there is no definitive answer. Are Tele Vue more expensive? Yes. Are they overpriced? The general consensus here is no, however depending on your point of view or funds available or whatever parameter you choose to employ, you could call them overpriced.In the end, the answer is arbitrary and more of a personal call. Me, I call them fairly priced for what I get.....",0
"and Lenny goes back to the irrelevant Plossl market yet again.  EDIT: Of course, it has already been demonstrated that TV Plossl's are not overpriced because they are relatively affordable and they continue to sell them because their customers want them..",0
"Then, perhaps, it's time to start saving for retirement?",0
"Hey:. I truly believe what I have consistently stated, thus to me it is a very relevant point. Heck, u can believe whatever u want but I truely believe I'm right.  Again in my opinion, when compaired to other plossls they are overpriced. But it's a pretty arbitrary point. I don't understand why that would upset anyone. All along, I have stated why I feel that way and that it is a matter of my opinion.  Per my last entry, I was responding to the previous post that I ""quoted"" and which supported the opposing view. As I have stated, I have enjoyed this thread because it is very interesting and informative. BTW, that's a great EMO, the guy beating a dead horse. Loved it.",0
"Actually... I believe you should compare a 32mm plossl to a 24mm 68 degree since both are max fov in 1.25"". IMHO, and I have compared these two eyepieces extensively for years, a TV 32mm plossl is a much sharper and well corrected eyepiece. Tighter stars to the field stop and NO field curvature. In the two telescopes I use them in (very similar focal lengths but different focal ratio ) there is a 17x difference. Exit pupils are 2.4mm vs 3.2mm or 3mm vs 4mm. Since these are max fov fl's I find the larger exit pupil is usually preferred. A 32mm. Televue plosssl is a much better eyepiece IMO. and well worth the (retail) price.. -Rob.",0

"I have a nagging feeling that Al nagler might be an anonymous browser on CN, and must have a ball reading CNers second guess his actions, thoughts, feelings, motivations.. If a company has remained in buisness for 4 decades with a vibrant track record of bringing new and innovative products to the market, then their past products cant be overpriced, regardless of what any or all consumers think.. And even if their products sell based only on ""good will and name recognition alone"" then they have played their cards very well.. Going forward, I broadly envision two scenarios: 1) ES sales have not really hurt TV significantly as a company and they will continue moving forward well founded in their trajectory, or 2) ES sales have really hurt TV significantly as a company - in which case they would have already lowered thier prices as much as they could while still attempting to survive. If this trend continues, then might indeed have to fold. But neither scenarios mean that TV are overpriced..",0

I have never belonged to a club or been to a star party or even known anyone else that had a scope to try another eyepiece so I couldn't say if TV eyepieces are over priced.

"I think this whole thread has been just beating a dead horse.. Some folks are going to always think anything is overpriced, and others will think they aren't. It's a function of what you want them for, and how important their functionality is in how you intend to use them that determines their value. And for a few, I suppose, their collectability could be a factor, too.... For my purposes, most other eyepieces don't perform to TeleVue standards, especially for edge performance. Some do. But those few that are in the same league rarely sell for less...",0

"And just when you thought this thread was beaten to death.... NEW TELE VUE EYEPIECE LEASING PROGRAM?. Leasing, why not? It makes sense and it's cheaper than a 2nd mortgage.

Yes, just $100 down and low, low, low payments of only $20 per month for 24 months and I'll slide you right into this beauty today. But wait, there's more...down the road, at the end of the lease, if you want to keep your Ethos, the buy-out is a measly $200...or, simply return it in good condition to Tele Vue and receive a $200 credit toward an equal or higher cost 2019 model. Want to buy in bulk? The Tele Vue Fleet Leasing Program can handle astronomy club orders from 6 or more people.

"Hey Lenny, what is a great 15-18mm Abbe Ortho under 100$ and did Tele Vue ever make any?. I think I'd be happy enough with eyepieces even if I had only 100-500$ to make a nice ep set. I'd probably end up with 3 used ES, TV or other ep's and the views would be rocking. Collecting ep's as a collection or because one can afford more of them, used or new, probably even produces slightly less total viewing time anyways... I'd get a used Radian and good abbe ortho or plossl for planetary, or a Delite. For deep space I'd get a used ES 24 or 28 with a 24 pan you'd be at the 500 mark...3 ep set. 12-14mm, 18mm, 24mm for an 8 SCT. I'd build it over a year:) and 2nd year get a 2"" ep.

Orion does 3 month payment plans on certain products. Maybe there is an idea to help some people get the TV eyepieces they desire. Buy a $600 eyepiece with 3 consecutive monthly payments of $200.,0

You get into big money when u expand the FOV, increase the eye relief, and keep the entire FOV sharp.  I increased my EP collection by identifying what I need and what I could afford. I then begin to look on the used/returned sections of most dealer sites. I also check Amazon and EBay. I have found real nice deals for EPs in all of those areas.  If I can't find a great deal I will often go with Meade series 4000 or Orion Sirius. But I always take my time..",0

Unless you have assets you don't want to liquidate but theoretically could if you had to, it seems like it would usually be a terrible idea to buy hobby equipment you can't pay off immediately.

You might say ""Then why not just save $200 a month for 3 months?"" Some people do that.. but then it is also more likely that you will find other spending obligations to siphon away those funds. Once you buy that eyepiece on a 3 month payment plan you are committed and that $200 must go toward it.

"Leasing eyepieces is never going to happen because the leaser has to make additional money to justify the risk.. Since it seems most people already regard them as expensive, would anyone agree to paying $700 for a $600 eyepiece? I doubt it.. As for leasing a car, consider this: if you figure you will always be making a monthly car payment for your whole life since your cars only go about the 5 or 6 year period before you trade them in,. if you lease, the monthly payment goes WAY down and you can get new cars more often, say every 3 years. And there's no hassle with a trade in since that's agreed to in advance.. I understand the average purchaser of a new car keeps the car for 8 years now (up from 2 years in the '60s), but that varies by location.. In my neighborhood, I'd say almost all cars are leased and newer than 3 years. Either that or everybody in my neighborhood has WAY more income than I ever did.. My wife and I see 100 cars of $80K+ just driving the 3 miles to the post office.. No, leasing, layaways, or financing are not going to happen in this business.

Hi: I don't really understands your post.  I was responding to a question about orthos and if TV had ever manufactured them.

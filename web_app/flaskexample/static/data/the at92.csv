"Looks like the Astronomcis AT92 will be avaible next year! Pretty exciting, looks like I need to start saving my pennies.",3
"Such a good, popular size, one of the largest GnG fracs IMO- besides maybe the 100mm tak dc (which is approx double the price) or the new SV 102 doublet.. Otherwise the 100mm really start pushing the mount requirements up. Awesome news.",0
That is very interesting news. I really like the size and capabilities of my Megrez 90mm - its a nice tweener and very light at around 7 lbs. It gives me so many mounting options as well - it even works well enough on my Orion Paragon Plus mount.. The AT92 is a bit pricey at $1795 - is it assumed to be a triplet at that price and maybe with FPL-53 glass?.,2
"It is a triplet with a center element of FCD100 (ED), one mating element of LAL14 (Lanthanum), and then a third element..",10
"At 16.5"" long is should be great as a grab and go scope..",5
The focal ratio will be f/5.5?. Looks very interesting. Definitely will make a nice grab and go..,2
It is f/5.5. Here is a link to the review of the original lens design when it was a TMB92.,1
"The TMB 92SS had a FPL-53 element. I'm not seeing this in your statement. Though it is stated that the new AT92 uses a revised design of the 92SS, do they use different glass?. Knowing the weight of the new AT92 (with rings) would be valuable. The 92SS was a heavyweight..",0
No weight yet. The center element is FCD100..,1
Does FCD100 have similar optical properties to FPL53? Bill.,0
"From the Hoya website. ""FCD100 is an extremely low dispersion optical glass equivalent to fluorite (CaF2). 　　　　 Relying on technological innovation, we have successfully launched the mass production of high-performance optical glass at the apex of the FCD family. Combining it with optical glass of high refractive index allows us to achieve unprecedented advanced chromatic aberration correction."".",1
Very nice. F/5.5 is just right for me. Will definitely be considering for tweener between AT72 and 120ST..,3
where will this scope be manufactured primarily optical elements..,0
"The same company that makes our EDT line will be making the 92, so it will be made in China. This company has been making telescopes for many years and has made telescopes that sell for well over $5000 here in the US. Their optics have been tested time and time again and have been used by throngs of satisfied customers..",7
Looks like the ultimate travel scope. Pack it in a carry-on bag and go anywhere. My only concern would be to find a mount sturdy and stable enough yet light and collapsible so that it can conveniently fit into check-on luggage. Any suggestions?.,1
"""Say hello to my little friend"". Wish I had the $$ to spend..",1
CEM25P.,1
"CEM25P, AT92 with a OSC would make a great portable imaging setup..",2
"Wanting a grab-n-go scope with astrophotographic capabilities, I'm considering quite a few refractors in the 100mm range. Question: would the f/5 AT92 be a significant improvement for photography over, say, the AT115 at f/7? Or are we splitting hairs here? I'm guessing it would be a significant improvement for photo use..",1
"For grab and go, mounting requirements will be less stringent with the AT92. Also, the shorter focal length will be easier to use with imaging. More photons on the sensor with wider fov. Tracking errors less problematic with shorter focal length I hear as well. Visually they are likely both great, the larger aperture will show you more, but the AT92 will likely be the more capable scope for your needs , by a good margin. Not splitting hairs, IMO.",1
given premium price why not get this manufactured in Japan or USA..,1
"We could for double the price. This was the most cost effective way to produce this instrument again. It is a little more expensive than the light TMB 92 when it was around and a little less expensive than the TMB92 with a feather touch.  Those were last produced 4 years ago and pricing has changed. Our optical house in Taiwan wanted double for the same optics and would not guarantee the minimum optic quality we wanted.  This scope is premium and will perform like a premium scope should, just not cost what a premium scope of this size and speed should cost.",10
"Still searching for that Goldilocks air travel scope. My TV-85 is an awesome traveler, but is just a bit less aperture than I'd like. My A-P Traveler has the aperture and still fits in carry-on, but the weight (with more mount needed), and form factor, are just a tad more than I'd prefer. So I'm really looking forward to comparing this. Placed my order today. :-).",4
In today's world China has the ability to make premium products. Folks used to laugh at Japan but that changed too. It contains cost making them in China and makes the product affordable..,6
Any plans for a reducer or other imaging accessories?.,1
"We will look at a dedicated reducer after the scopes get out and about, however I am concerned about the cost as the scope is already f/5.5. I am unsure how reasonably priced a dedicated reducer could be as the scope would be really fast when it is all said and done. The TMB92 worked very well with our generic field flattener..",1
"Also, the image circle is 48mm..",1
The review mentions a removable 2-1/4 inch section of the tube on the TMB92. Is this also a feature of the new AT92?. -Alex.,0
It will not have that feature..,0
Could be worth selling my SV70ed doublet for this as my grab-and-go..,0
"Any word on whether this will come with a case, or rings and dovetail? It looks like the 92SS was able to get nice and short for an airplane carry-on bag, hoping the little AT92 will be able to do so as well. This is an enticing scope but I would rather have a doublet with this aperture and maybe slightly slower f-ratio to save on cost while still being airplane-portable. The TS 90mm that unscrews into multiple tube sections might be the better option, and it's quite a lot cheaper. It is also a more binoviewer-friendly option which would be excellent for a rich field scope like the AT92/TS90..",1
"Last I saw on the web site, it does come with rings, dovetail, and case. :-). Alex.",1
"Ha, I must have missed then when looking at their lineup. With rings, dovetail, and case, $1800 is a little easier to swallow. Still pretty spendy but probably close to fair given the optical quality..",0
"When going to the Astronomics web site, the AT92 is not. listed under refractors. (?). But you can still find it under Manufacturers/Astrotech. Alex.",0
"Can we assume that the focuser is the same assembly that is used on the other EDT's? As a 130EDT owner, I would consider that to be a positive..",2
"Excellent.. I was searching on the website but could not find the info. FCD100 is the Hoya equivalent to the well known O'hara FPL53.. -> IMO, you should really emphasize it on the product webpage. It is a key point (go/no go to me) which makes all the difference on a such fast triplet.. Great job, great product, congratulations. Olivier. p.s. having some AP, I still miss my AT106...may be the AT92 could cure the pain....",1
I need to buy some Hoya stock... Is FCD100 glass that expensive? the AT80 is 750$ and the 92 is 1800$. With a scope that small at this f/ could you really notice any difference between FPL-51 and FPL-53 / FCD100?.,1
"Well, I simply can't see how one could go wrong with this OTA. (Pre-) Ordered.",3
"Glass is one part of the equation. These objectives are specifically figured, based on the design of two legends of the business. Ask anyone who has a LOMO or TMB designed objective in this size class. For visual observers, this scope will take more magnification with less spurious color than cheaper designs. For AP, the benefits should be obvious. I'll bet they stay priced at a premium in the used market as well. They're not for everyone, and that's just fine - but like many hobbys, the cost slope to get the very best gets very steep towards the end",2
"Explore is also using FCD100 in some of their designs. Their 80F6 triplet is less expensive, but the design is more ""common"", the manufacture has probably already it on the shelves. Which is a different story for the AT92.. Yes, the difference between FPL51/FCD1/FK61 and FPL53/FCD100 is obvious for AP.. On the 80mm F6 triplet, the FPL51 is still acceptable. At the edge, but still good enough for many users.. But with 92 and at F5.5, FPL53 is mandatory, and there is not much margin if any..",1
"1) I understand 48mm with your generic flatener, is it right? which flatener exactly?. because I had the 2"" AT FF with the AT106, but its output has T2 thread i.e. less than 42mm of free aperture. However, its quality and performance are excelent together with the AT106. So is there any larger FF which fits into the 2.5 focuser?. 2) Any idea of the weight yet ? Between the TMB92L and the TMB92FT ? about 3Kg?.",0
"1. The image circle was calculated without the flattener by the lens manufacturer. We will get one in hand and put it through its paces to verify everything. We will have a dedicated flattener to will attach to the focuser after we get one here to verify all the measurements. It will be sent off to Roger and he will work on the design when he isn't working on 3 meter mirrors. lol. 2. No clue on weight, but I believe you are on the right path..",1
"Mike, forgive me if this was already covered somewhere, but I can't find any details. Will this come with a 2.5"" Feathertouch focuser like the original TMB92? The cost of the scope suggests that it should, as the original was roughly the same price and almost a quarter of the cost of the scope was the focuser. Otherwise I suppose I'm curious where the money is going in terms of production cost and product value. I would expect most people to want a premium focuser on a premium little scope like this... I know I would.. I'm also curious about the potential price of the dedicated flattener. I assume it will not be cheap in any sense of the word, but from what I've seen from similarly fast scopes, it will absolutely need one, maybe even for visual observation.. Oh, how this scope torments me... I am going to cross my fingers and hope that the economy gods smile upon me. I don't want to miss out on this. But it's going to be ungodly expensive for such a small scope..",0
"It doesn't come with the 3"" FT as the original. The $700 price point was too pricey and we feel the upgraded version of the EDT focuser is going to give the FT a run for its money in most categories. When the original TMB92 was released there wasn't any other real option out there and Werner made the 3"" FT specifically for our scope. Over the past 7 years or so the focusers have improved dramatically.. That being said, the closet current competition is the CFF 92 at f/6 with a 3"" FT focuser that runs $3600 USD, roughly double the cost.. I think we are right on target with our pricing of the 92 as we have ""updated"" the design and kept cost split between the two old scopes even though our lens cost went up 55% since we last had them produced..",2
It won't need a dedicated flattener for visual. The TMB92 has been out in the field for years and has never had a dedicated flattener. It has been an awesome visual instrument as well as photographic instrument..,1
"Yikes, a 55% increase in lens cost? Well dang, consider me uninformed. Is that due to shortages of FPL-53 or another necessary resource? I know inflation hasn't devalued the dollar that badly.... I appreciate the transparency; it certainly makes me feel more confident about purchasing from you. But it still stings to think about dropping $2000 on the scope and then likely another $300-500 on a flattener and then another $100-200 on a case, etc etc... and that's again without a Feathertouch. It all adds up. But I digress... this is the cost of the hobby, it just hurts to see when seeing numerous TMB92SS sold on CN for $1500, with the FT and a case.. I'll just keep on dreaming over here. Thanks Mike..",0
We will see about the flattener. It really comes down the economy of scale for it.. It is a number of things that raised the price. The number would have been higher if we didn't hit a certain Minimum Production Quantity..,1
"I was thinking of the Esprit 80 or Stellarvue 80 for getting into imaging. Would the AT92 pair well with the Sky-Watcher AZ-EQ5? That combo would travel well, I think..",1
When are these expected to arrive?. -Jim.,0
I'd think that would work very well. You certainly wouldn't be undermounted..,1
"Mike's original email said ""1st quarter 2018 if all goes well"". Here's hoping all goes well",2
We look to be on that schedule still..,3
"I have learned that patience has its rewards. When it came to the AT 130EDT, I was patient, and I was rewarded. Richly..",4
"There is an XT10 to figure into my equation. I'm still not clear on whether that mount can run an XT10 and an 80mm in alt-az mode together. But that's for another forum.. Would the ZWO ASI-1600 be a good match for this scope? I was thinking of 1.25"" RGB filters but I'm not sure with the bigger circle of this 92, so maybe the next size up..",0
"You'd be lucky to get the AZ-EQ5 to hold an XT10 tube, maybe for visual but I'd be wary for imaging. You'd probably want to step up to the AZ-EQ6 for that. You will probably have to go to 2"" filters for the large image circle of the AT92, especially if you end up using a flattener that is also a reducer. The image circle is 48mm without a reducer, so I think 2"" is necessary, which gives you 50.8mm of coverage. I think the ASI1600MM would be an excellent choice but there are so many technicalities with sensor and pixel size that I'll tell you not to take my word for it. I'm still learning a lot about imaging myself so I'm looking forward to seeing what someone else says..",1
"The XT10 on that mount would be strictly visual, except for Lunar/Solar. When I am ready to capture images it would come off and the fast refractor would go onto the mount in EQ mode. The plan is to have a nice outeach setup, a good beginning wide-field imaging setup, and then to use the 10"" reflector on its dob base if I get tired of looking at a laptop..",0
fpl-53 for a lot less. f/5.5 can you say chromatic abrasion.,0
"Are you thinking the AT92 will have a lot of chromatic aberration? It's tough to combat at such fast focal ratios, but this is a triplet with FCD-100, Lanthanum, and an unknown third element, with the design coming from Thomas Back. I have a feeling chromatic aberration will be very hard to see with the AT92, in visual observation or imaging..",2
"I'll assume you mean chances of ""chromatic aberration"" with respect to the AT92. The answer is: Slim and none, and Slim just left town..",5
Feel free to read the Sky and Telescope review of the original TMB92 that the AT92 takes it heritage from. I think you will be pleasantly surprised..,2
"I'm also curious as to how the AT92 will fair optically vs the esprit 80. I like that the esprit is f5 (wider FOV), granted, the AT92 will be, by all accounts, great visually and photographically, whereas by all accounts, the esprit is not so great visually. My primary concerns are optical quality and FOV. I'm thinking of the AT92 too, but it's FOV calculates to around 120 arcminutes with the ZWO ASI 1600MM camera, whereas the esprit 80 manages 150 arcminutes. I want to avoid stitching, and be able to image the larger widefield nebulas. By all accounts, the esprit range has very good optics (photographically). Both are priced pretty similar when it comes down to the poor Aussie dollar. Another advantage to the SkyWatcher esprit for me, is that it's available locally, with a local warranty, whereas if I buy the AT92, I'll have to pay high shipping costs back to the US of A.... Since both are APO triplets, and similarly priced, they should, in theory, perform similarly from an optical point of view. I can't find anywhere that states whether the esprit 80 uses FPL-53 elements or not. Decisions, decisions!.",0
"Judging from what you want to do, I think you have already made your decision. As for whether the Esprit uses FPL53 glass, the video they put up says it does..",1
"yes, I saw that after I had posted my early reply. Schott/FPL53/Schott I believe..",0
What's the image circle on the Esprit 80? I've been looking at the Stellarvue 80 and I think the increased size and bigger filter requirements for the AT92 may hold me back. Maybe..,0
"this page:. https://www.astronom...-refractor.html. says the imaging circle is 33mm. I don't know if that's correct, but I have read that on another website too (but can't remember which one). For me, that's not an issue, since it should be fine with the ZWO ASI 1600MM-C that I'm interested in (at least, as far as I understand, it should be fine). At worst case scenario, I suspect the corners may have vignetting, and images may need to be cropped. Someone, please correct me if I am wrong! I'd rather be wrong, and corrected, before I spent any money!!!!!!. edit: I was looking at the 1.25"" zwo filters for their EFW, I wonder if that'll mean that not all of the imaging circle will be within the radius of the filters then?). Again, please correct me if I'm wrong!.",0
"If you are looking for an Esprit, I would hold off a few more days.....",1
"Thanks for the heads up Michael - I believe SkyWatcher are gonna have their esprit range on sale [in the US]. The problem is:. a) I'm in Australia. b) the Australian dollar is very weak vs the greenback. c) shipping is pricey (must include insurance too!). d) item will be >= AUD $1k on arrival in Australia, and will subsequently attract a 5% import duty and then a 10% GST on the original items value + 5% import duty + shipping costs! There's a reason why Australia is considered the 2nd highest taxed country in the world...but then again, our pollies (Aussie slang for politicians) need to book 75 km helicopter flights to private weddings you see (with public tax payers monies)! Yes, that was a snide political remark at our back boneless lazy and good for nothing politicians. I could tell you a nice joke about Australian politicians, but it's probably better to be done privately lol! Note that the Australian prices on the esprit range are actually cheaper than the standard US prices (after US ==> AUD $ parity conversion etc). SkyWatcher Australia has been very aggressive with the pricing in Australia to push the range to local consumers. That makes it even harder to justify from buying overseas and privately importing said goods into the country! In the end, it actually works out more expensive for me to privately import said item from the US to Australia, than if I'd actually just bought it locally...and Australian customs misses nothing - they'd charge the hell out of a fly on a dunny (dunny is Aussie slang for toilet if you dont' know) in order to make a buck if they could ;-). Then there's no local warranty, and shipping said items back to the US for issues gets rather expensive very quickly!. Note: if I've misunderstood the gist of your post, please correct me!.",0
New Astro-Tech product hype???!!?.,0
My note was pointed towards to the gent in the US as we aren't able to ship Sky-Watcher outside the US due to the dealer agreements that every US dealer signs. Sorry for the confusion..,1
"Ahh! That's easily avoidable, I have a US proxy shipping address ;-). but it's still not financially viable anyway!.",1
"I own AT111EDT, AT72ED and have used 65EDQ, I like all.. I am looking for a faster scope for wide angle AP, preferably in F4, 400mm focal length range.. Based on information in the post:. - How good is the focuser? and what is the payload? Do you provide option to upgrade focuser to FT as Stellarvue does? I think all 3 AT scopes weakest link is focuser, I feel that they either slip or wobble under 8lbs load (which I current have). So I replaced them with Moonlite.. - Any plan to have dedicated reducer to get it to F/4? Another candidate I am looking at is SVQ100, which is said to have F/4 reducer.. - Is it going to support full frame CCD with flattener and/or reducer?. Thanks.",0
"34d party focusers such as feathertouch and moonlight are always going to surpass stock focusers imho, as they are a lot more expensive. 8lbs is a lot!. I think I saw someone answer the imaging circle question, but can't find it now and can't remember the exact answer off the top of my head. I'd expect the AT92 to very similar, if not near identical to the well respected TMB92SS..",0
"The focuser is very nice. It will be a step above our focusers on the EDT series. We do not have an upgrade route for the focuser. 8 pounds is a ton for those focusers. Usually the weight limit is around 5-6 pounds, even on the 2"" Feathertouch models. I have been given a quote of 10 pounds or so on the focuser that is on the 92.. You may want to double check the information on the SVQ100. They don't list a reducer for that scope. It might be hard to come by as we don't have a reducer for the 65 due to the built-in flattener. I have a feeling SV is running into the same problem.. I am pulling this from memory, but I believe the image circle is right at 44mm on the 92..",1
"SVQ reducer is not yet available but I think they are working on it, according to my friend who owns the scope. There are not many choices on short focal length, fast scope. I think SVQ wants to compete with TAK FSQ, which traditionally has issues with their mechanicals. I believe 92 could be another contender (with dedicated reducer) in this market segment, but then focuser is very crucial for F4 system since it might have alignment issue with large payload.. AT65EDQ is really nice, I could get flat FOV on full frame DSLR (though with much worse vignette on corners), but it is a bit slower.. BTW, for 8300 CCD, is flattener required to get flat FOV? or it is only required for full frame CCD?.",0
"Mike, is there any expectation for when we might see a prototype of this here scope?.",0
"I would hope shortly, but I don't have a solid date yet..",0
Do we have an idea of the weight of this scope?.,0
We'll know when we get the production prototype in for testing..,1
"I believe Mike has said it will be somewhere around 3kg, probably a little over. Looking forward to seeing the prototype!.",1
"A big difference between the TMB92SS and TMB92L is the weight, due in part to the L not having a collimatable cell. Will the AT92 have a collimatable cell?. I wonder how this triplet design would compare with the equally-fast fluorite-doublet design of the Borg 92FL? I note that the Borg does not use a collimatable cell, yet it was designed as a portable 'scope and presumably able to withstand the inevitable bumps and knocks, so maybe 90mm-size is in the goldilocks range of not requiring complex and heavy cells?.",0
Bump...  any further word on....  Prototype arrival?.  Weight?.  Still on schedule?. Alex.,0
I am looking at the AT 92 triplet as a potential upgrade of my current 80ED scope. Eagerly waiting for some news - testing or otherwise to get some more details. Thanks all (and Mike & Fred) for their generous contributions here..... Anil.,0
Still on schedule. Nothing on the other two yet..,1
"Mike, to clarify... does on schedule still mean Q1 2018? And if you could say, would you say sooner or later in Q1? Forgive me if I'm mis-remembering. Thanks!.",0
"We were hoping for end of January 2018. I asked for an update yesterday, but I have not made it into work yet to check my mail..",0
The sample should be finished this week. With any luck we will see it next week..,2
Exxxxxxcellent. That is very very good news Mike. I may fight off this Takitis after all! End of January is honestly not that far away....,0
We have the original TMB92 here to test it against and verify it is all it should be..,5
"Hot business. Are you going to do a full optical bench to compare them, as well as a real night under the stars, or just an optical bench? Or how are you going to compare them? And... one last thing, when you get the time, I would also love to get some final measurements for LxWxH, as well as the weight. Thanks Mike!! Really looking forward to seeing some photos and hearing how it compares to the original..",0
We will do under the stars. When we get it here we will take all the measurements and post them..,1
Just curious as to whether there is anything new to report. No pressure..,0
"I'm also eager to hear! I'm especially curious about how much it weighs. If it's not too much trouble, could you weigh the dew shield and maybe focuser by themselves? Trying to figure out how much weight I could save if I modded it with lighter materials, to maximize its portability for travel..",0
"Being that it's a rainy night in Georgia, time to give this another bump.. Has the sample arrived, and if so, was it tested and deemed satisfactory? Any specs yet?. Thanks!. Alex.",0
It was at94 Strehl.  They are continuing to work on it so it hits the95 minimum.  I also assume finishing up our 102 and 60EDs have gotten in the way.,1
"Thanks for the update, Mike!. Alex.",0
"Mike, do you think the 102's are headed this way yet?.",1
Happy 2018 everyone!. Bumping this topic up - keen to hear the latest news re: the AT92..,3
Just gonna go ahead and uh bump this thread real quick... would love to hear how the reworked optics are coming..,0
"Jay, reading of your experience with the Borg, I was about to ask if you were still considering the AT92. :-). Still have mine on order, and am hoping for an update as well. My main concern is that they get things right, so a bit of a delay is not that big a deal. Alex.",1
"I'm really curious about the weight honestly! Once Mike clears the optics I wouldn't worry too much about them. If it can be reduced to a low weight, only a little more than the 90FL, then it might be the better scope..",0
Agreed. Hoping the weight comes in less than or at least close to my TV-85. Alex.,0
More silence from Mike (in the AT102ED thread too)... wonder what's up. Maybe he's been on vacation since Christmas! I wish I still was....,0
"Hmmm, it's been I think two months now since there's been any more news from our sponsor. Hoping everything is going ok.. Alex.",0
"Got on the list for this scope after thinking an 80mm scope was the right size. Just can't get away from maximum aperture while maintaining a ""grab-n-go"" sized scope. Hopefully we'll be able to test them out in March!.",0
I managed to get Mike to comment on this.https://www.cloudyni...q/#entry8400586.,1
Good to know. Thanks for passing on the information. I see you have the Stellarvue M2C. I'm interested in this mount for the AT92. Are you happy with it?.,0
"I was a little fussy with it at first because I wasn't used to the tension knobs moving the axes directly (was using an AYO II) and I had to learn how to balance it properly. After about an hour of cumulative use though, I figured out the balance midpoint for my typical eyepieces, and the tension knobs have notloosened up but they aren't stiff or hard to turn now. I actually quite like the mount; it's incredibly smooth compared to my UniStar Deluxe, which people love to recommend. I think the M2C would be ideal for the AT92, absolutely. It works great with my TV-85..",0
"Thanks for the feedback. I'm also thinking of the Losmandy AZ8 so I could use another scope at the same time, but they seem to be in very tight supply..",0
You might inquire about just getting an AZ8 mount head and buying your own tripod for it. That's what I did when I found out that getting parts for the Losmandy tripod was where the big holdup was. Not sure if that is still the case but worth looking into..,1
"Thanks mogur-I think I did see one site with just the mount, but it might be gone now. I was a little slow figuring that out. I have some time so maybe I’ll get one by the time the scope is available. Seems like all the stuff I like is back ordered, or not available yet.",0
Just ordered the At92 I heard mid March. Can anyone elaborate? Will be my first triplet. Really happy with my other two At Scopes. This one will hopefully be that much better!.,0
"I called a week or two ago, and they said that they were ""putting the finishing touches"" on the scopes, whatever that means. They did say that it would take a month or so from when they get notice of shipment, to when they could ship to us. At that time they did not have a date. So every day that goes by without word, I assume at least another month. Have had one on order since August. At this rate I may get the call from Astro-Physics first. :-). Alex.",3
Good things come to those who wait.. Curious to hear reports on this scope once in people's hands..,1
How much does the AT92 cost?.,0
"About a 40XW, 30XW, plus a 12.5 Docter. :-). Maybe a tad less. Or $1795.",1
If you are a CN member that’s worth a 5% discount. Just mention when you order to get the 5%..,1
Thanks for the update. I didn't mention the cn member. I forgot about that. Better fix that. 90.00 discount..,0
Call them and let them know..,0
Thanks Don w I emailed them and let them know..,0
Bump! Would love to learn more about this - any dates to report?.,0
"Will it be binoviewer friendly, even without the removable section the TMB 92 had? Shawn",0
"I was really excited about this when announced, and placed my order back in August, thinking perfect travel scope. But as the makers have been ironing out the wrinkles, I've now become a lot more comfortable traveling with my 4-inch refractor, and enjoying its great views. Have been wondering of late whether or not to just move on. Either way, I hope they get things right soon and have a great product to offer. Alex.",0
"Getting awfully close to the end of Q1, hoping Mike and crew can deliver. It's looking like they won't, unfortunately. I'm really curious to hear how these perform but the silence makes me worry just a little.. Alex, you have to get one so you can tell me how it compares to the TV-85!!.",2
"Perhaps some good news for those considering a pre-order - I reached out to astronomics about remaining availability in their initial production run and was given this answer:. ""We will have plenty in stock with this initial run and you can place an order now and no charge is done till it is ready to ship."". Edit: Was also just told ""we are still looking at a first quarter availability""..",0
If you’re comfortable with the 4” you should just enjoy the additional aperture it provides. I think the main advantage of a 90 mm scope is mainly compactness.. Patrick.,1
"And the 92 would hopefully have less robust mounting requirements. Am currently trying out the Vamo Traveler mount, a great travel mount, with the 4-inch, and if it works out, I'll probably stick with the 4. The AT92 would hopefully not have a problem with the mount. Alex.",0
"I will compare it to the TV-85 and the AP105, and I can already tell you now how it will turn out. All three will be excellent and have certain advantages and disadvantages. I won't be able to make up my mind, and will then have money tied up in three travel refractors. With no money left to travel!. Alex.",4
Just wanted to revive this thread. Has any body heard anything from our awesome sponsor about when these babies are going to roll into town? I can't wait to image through a good triplet!.,0
Q1 has come and gone! Bummer. Hoping Astronomics has some treats for willing early adopters soon!.,0
Why not call Mike and ask him and then post. If he's able to read this post he may respond himself..,1
"Bump.. I hope our our sponsors don't see these posts and bumps as being a pain in the rear, but rather as an indication of the excitement about this product. Anxiously awaiting product release or updated information. Alex.",0
I was told by the gentleman at our sponsors that they are wanting the scope to be 100% before they get shipped. Better to wait for a perfect scope than get a half baked scope quickly. We have to be patient.☺.,2
"100 percent in agreement with their philosophy. I don't think anyone minds the wait if there is a superior telescope shipped at the end of the wait. I see this, and possibly they do too, as maybe their flagship product..",2
I hope it becomes their flagship product. A 92mm refractor is such a nice size to own by virtue of its size:weight: performance ratios. The price of the AT 92 will allow many more folks to own a quality refractor of that aperture..,2
"Yes. And given the 92's esteemed heritage, they should consider tweaking the name, maybe something like AT92-BC.. Alex.",0
"Maybe the AT92-Q2, given its release date.... Sorry, I'll show myself out.",4
That's funny rusty.,0
Of course we would love for it to be 100% before shipping. Many products today are not. If I had any complaint it would be with communication and nothing else. It seemed foolish of them to say they are still expecting it to ship in Q1 when the end of Q1 is a week or two away with literally no details about the fixed prototype or the shipment of a bunch of them on a slow boat from China. Why not say it will likely be early-mid Q2? What happened to under-promise and over-deliver? What happened to Mike? He was super active in this thread but has been basically absent since the new year started..,0
Maybe there are other more pressing things Mike is working on..,0
"Doesn't take much to give a quick update :\. I think Jay's comment is spot on, unfortunately..",0
Honestly at this point I just hope everything is OK with him because he has hardly posted at all on CN. Hopefully we hear from him soon..,1
"Yes, like overhauling the website..",0
"Or perhaps family, health or other issues. Not that I know and I do not.. Selling astronomy products and services Mike and his family are doing a great service in a industry that is relatively small. So my thoughts are if you are really interested in this product or ANY product Astronomics sells as it's own, please be patient as they are not a big company with deep pockets. They rely on their vendors, if Astronomics is going to put their name on a product they want it to be sure what they advertise is going to be what the customer gets before they release it,...because each of those AT products put their reputation on the line..",2
"Astronomics is a business that makes a profit from customers like us. We don't owe them anything for this ""great service"" they provide us (as Astronomics, CN aside). I have no doubt it is not easy running a small business in a niche industry so please don't mistake my criticism for a lack of empathy. All I'm saying is bad communication is bad for business..",1
Well I hate to say it Jay but that's really how it reads..,3
"Not much I can do about that. Your comments read as if you're making excuses for and defending the vendor in a situation where you also have no idea why they're acting the way they are. I've given them the benefit of the doubt continuously but at a certain point they're hurting their client prospects and loyalty (not for customers like you though). I have respect for what they do but at some point poor business practices will hurt them. I had a similar situation happen in the mechanical keyboard community; a vendor (Keyclack) launched a partnership for a new board and started the group buy. Got everyone's money, probably around $125k, and sent it on for production and whatnot. The board was supposed to be finished in May 2017 with shipping in June to buyers. In May it was revealed it would not be on time. Details got more and more sparse in the following months and there was a period of a good few months without a single word from Keyclack. Many people emailed them for refunds. Many people were outspoken on the forums. You know what the overwhelming opinion was? ""I don't care if I get my board late, I just want to know what the heck is going on and if I'm even going to get it at all."" This is the same sentiment I have expressed regarding the AT92, nothing more. BTW, I eventually got my board in November 2017, almost a full 6 months after I was supposed to get it. Some people got theirs even later, I was in the middle of the group. No one in the mechanical keyboard community even trusts Keyclack anymore (or the founder who took on way too much and then decided to vanish) which is a bummer because they were professional for a while and the owner seemed to be a decent guy.. I am not saying Mike and crew are bad people. I'm not saying they're idiots. I'm saying their poor communication is going to hurt their business and as a prospective customer I would like better communication. We shouldn't unconditionally defend the ones we care about; we should know when to be straight with them, so that they may improve. I want to see Astronomics improve; I want to see an awesome AT92; I want to see more custom designs from Astronomics as well. I want Astronomics to cement their position as a retailer that offers you something the other 10 can't, and that means providing more frequent and more detailed communication (and I'm NOT talking about those darn Sky-Watcher Maksutov sales emails)..",0
"Agree with you, Jay - in business, communication is everything. Of course we all hope the lack of communication is not due to poor health or similar but, given Astronomics has taken pre-orders for this product, someone from the company (doesn't have to be Mike) really should take a moment out of their day to provide an update. I'm sure all would understand the delay if kept informed. This happens all the time in my business, which also involves complicated and somewhat niche products dependent on specialised parts only available from a handful of vendors - customers understand (within reason) as long as they feel informed.. If you don't communicate and provide updates customers become concerned and draw their own conclusions, usually to the detriment of your brand.. unfortunate, but this is just a fact of life and human nature!.",0
"You guys need to get a life. Really. Astronomics provides this site free for all of you to **** and complain. This business is a tiny, tiny niche with little to very slim profit margins. If you can't be patient, go somewhere else.. It gets really old..",5
"I think the folks at Astronomics would like to avoid this, which is exactly Jay's point..",1
"Sure they would. But where are you going to go? All the TMB92SS have been sold. There was one on CN's classifieds a couple of weeks ago and it sold within an hour or so. The CFF 92s are much more expensive. So where exactly are we to go? Yes, we could go to an 80mm scope (whether an AT or ES or SW or Tak) or a 100mm scope (same).. But can we really pop into Walmart and get one? How about putting your order on Amazon? Maybe they can ship it overnight if you have a Prime membership.. Please understand. Astronomics puts their money on the line and special orders a run of these scopes to sell to the community at a price which is really great. It is not just a matter of calling up China and say stick it on a containership so we can sell a few thousand copies. They are trying to control the quality as well. This is a very low unit volume market. As in very low. Extremely low.. So it is always frustrating to wait. I'm sure Michael is working his best to get these out, just as he did with the recent slew of AT 80s, 115s and 130s.. Continuing to rant on these forums is not going to change anything.. But, heck, maybe you can go somewhere else. Please let us know where that might be..",1
"The problem is that none of what you described precludes them from communicating delays with folks who placed pre-orders.. I don't think anyone here isn't being understanding of setbacks, regardless of their nature. The only complaint is a lack of an open line of communication, especially following the recent missed deadline.. I think that's all I'll contribute to this discussion. It seems as though we're going in circles..",1
"I check in to this thread regularly. When I see there are new posts, I'm curious about possible new information. The majority of the thread has been positive. Excitement for this telescope is real and justified. I'm anxious to see it, as are many here.. But when I tune in here and see accusatory remarks and criticism, I get very turned off. I may even agree that the communication hasn't been good recently, but I accept it. No amount of _____ing and complaining is going to help anything. As someone mentioned earlier, it gets old. And as said earlier, nobody owes anybody anything. OK, we get it. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would love to see this thread go back to it's happy place. When I see a new telescope coming out with TMB in it's pedigree, it makes me happy.",3
"Ahhh, so much ado over nothing. If Mike/Astronomics took 5 minutes a month to post a single update to this thread, even if it's ""no new info"", this could all be averted. Not asking for the scope NOW, not asking for them to ship out half finished scopes. Literally asking for about 20 words to be typed.. This thread's happy place is in a time when Astronomics was still providing updates about the progress of this scope's development. Not a multiple-month lull after Mike drummed up a bunch of excitement and then disappeared. You know how excited I was to see this scope for myself but I decided to go for other scopes like a Borg 90FL and a TV-85. These are not exact replacements but they are what's available, and theyareavailable. People will buy this scope, that's great. It just won't be anyone who wanted/needed one in Q1 for whatever reason. Maybe not even Q2!. We are indeed going in circles. People asking for more communication (that's all, folks, that's all that was said!!!!) are again getting bashed with ""you don't know how hard they work, they walk uphill both directions every day to sell you everything at a loss, how dare you tell one of your favorite business what you think they need to do to improve!"" Right, I should let my favorite ma 'n pa shop die out because they made bad business decisions and all of their ultra-loyal customers kept telling them they're doing nothing wrong. I don't see it that way.. I'm done arguing now, as it's clear I have been labeled as nothing but a naysayer with no logic or valid reasoning in my posts. Mike and crew are obviously doing a great job at managing expectations around here so there's no need to ask what's up. They will let you know, guys. Just, go find another hobby, forget about astro. Maybe next year or the year after that they will have an AT92 for you.. Best of luck to Astronomics and all pre-orderers with the refined design. I hope it's good.. -j.",1
https://www.teleskop...5--focuser.html. Not in stock either though.,0
"That's a F 6.6 scope. The AT is F5.5.. I understand the frustration. From past memory with other AT products, I recall Astronomics chiming in and then periods of quiet. It is frustrating. But this is very typical of this small industry.. These forums have been used at times to gauge customer interest in a product (and not just Astronomics). And then the long time from idea to actual shipment.. But they will eventually ship. And it is a very unique scope. 92mm at F5.5. Most refractors with this aperture are much longer, as is the TS 90mm F6.6..",0
"We apologize for not communicating as frequently as we should have concerning the AT92. Unfortunately, “the best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men / Gang aft a-gley.” Sometimes real life interferes with our best intentions, and sometimes it’s harder than pulling teeth with your bare hands to get updates from the manufacturer. Rather than a weekly posting of “no news to report,” we attended to more pressing issues. Our bad, sorry.. Now that we are two weeks past our hoped-for 1st quarter delivery, here’s the latest information Our manufacturer (who is working on both the AT92 and the AT152EDT triplets simultaneously) is reporting a Strehl of 0.946 for the AT92. We had requested a Strehl of 0.95 or better, and they have been working towards that goal. However, at this fast a focal ratio, we may have to accept a 0.94 or better Strehl in order to hold the price point. An interesting fact: the original TMB130 and 92 that Tom designed for us were only internally speced at 0.9 Strehl or better and yet they managed to get glowing revues and great reputations, which they maintain to this day.. We can’t guarantee a ship date on the 92 and 152, as there are too many variables out of our control. The OTA’s are done, just awaiting lens cells. If we freeze the AT92 lenses at 0.94 or better, the scopes could ship in 4-6 weeks or less. A month in transit and Customs and we’re shipping in the second quarter. Is that guaranteed? No, but it’s highly probable.. For those who have concerns about those individuals who preordered the AT92, be aware that we do not require payment up front for a preorder. We risk our money when producing a new product. We do not ask for, nor do we expect, our customers to share the risk inherent in producing a new scope.. For or those who “hope” the AT92 will be good, please be aware that the delay in shipping has been so we can guarantee that the scope will be better than just “good.” The Astro-Tech reputation has been built on producing scopes that out-produce their price point. The AT92 and AT152EDT will continue that tradition.. Thanks for reading..",21
Thank you frebie..,0
"Since Astronomics is a great company to deal with - from price to value to customer support - those waiting for the AT92 or AT152EDT can rest assured that they will be pleased with their transaction, one way or another..",1
"And just for giggles. There have been no updates of anything really important this year. We don’t receive, or ask for, product updates monthly.  I will ask quarterly however.  And yes, we have been busy revamping our website and I spent the first six weeks of the year preparing for federal trial that involved the DDoS attacks on CN and astronomics.  That put me behind a tad work wise.",2
"Thanks Frebie.. As as someone who placed an order in August and is keeping the scope on order, you will get no complaints from me if it takes longer to hold out for and get the original Strehl standard. The wait will have been worth it. (Not that you're taking a poll or anything, and I'm just one person.). I can wait for quality. Just an occasional ""we're still working on it"" update is sufficient. :-). Alex.",4
"Oh I feel your pain on that one, trust me! Feels like I spend half my time at work on just this kind of activity.. Likewise, I know how tough it can be when it becomes apparent an adjustment in the target product profile is necessary. My two cents: I imagine the real-world/observable difference between 0.946 and 0.95 is probably more psychological than observable. Let's face it, you're 99.5% of the way there.. that's statistical/rounding error territory! (What's the margin of error in theStrehl test, anyway?). Not really for me to say of course, as I don't have one on pre-order. (I am hoping to get approval from my accountant to add one of these to my collection in future, however - sounds like the perfect travel scope, and the price point is very competitive!).",1
Thanks Fred (frebie) and Mike..,1
Can you tell us the requested (or expected) Strehl of the AT152EDT?. Thank you!. Heywood.,0
?.,0
Does Astronomics have any future plans on a flourite apo?.,0
"The current EDT scopes all are speced to have a Strehl of 0.90 or better. Production scopes typically fall into the ""or better"" category. With a lanthanum rear element, the 152 should likewise fall into the ""or better"" category..",4
"We have had a number of fluorite apo designs in various sizes and focal ratios by Roger Ceragioli in our vaults for the past six years. The problem is that none of the five lens makers we deal with, or have dealt with, are willing to work with fluorite. So, yes, we literally have fluorite plans but, no, we do not have any fluorite apos in our production plans for the immediate future..",2
Takes a very special and skilled optician to work with the delicacies inherent in the Fluorite crystal. It is not for the faint of heart. But we already know this; DON'T WE !?.,0
"I would be guessing here but it seems that the difficulties of working fluorite while keeping breakage low (and therefore prices at a reasonable point for a larger vendor interested in volume) make it a difficult proposition. Hence the market niche for the bespoke OTAs at over $1,000 per inch. This is also interesting information in terms of why the FS doublets from Tak disappeared from the market.  It's saying this is a *difficult* production issue. And the fact that Yuri is willing to venture into major fluorite production runs at 140 mm diameter says a great deal about his confidence in what he can do.. There is a lot about astronomy that is simple in principle but difficult in execution. You would think that making a mount that holds steady and tracks is a fairly simple thing to do. In fact it is very difficult and many don't make the grade. You would think that making a focuser that is precise and smooth and doesn't break wouldn't be that hard. In fact people pay very high prices to get it done right, as opposed to good 'nuff.. GN.",2
"92 mm f/5.5 for under $2k has got to be brutal. And it may be asking for problems if the slightest thing goes wrong with alignment etc. Myself, I have let go of the fast scope fetish. Will try to keep to f/7 or more in the future, though I don't know if I have a refractor buying future. I've already got plenty..",0
Finished production model is in the way and should be here next week. 1/6th wave and956 strehl according to the interferometer report. We have a TMB 92 in house that we can reference it against.,16
Congratulations!. Need to start sweet-talking my accountant...,1
"Michael, Thanks for keeping us updated. I look forward to the unveiling..",0
That is going to be awesome to see that and the AT 152 also when it comes in. If I wanted either scope I would have to sell my CPC 1100 and my AT 130 and AVX to even come close to get the AT 152 or the AT 92 but I think if I did I would get the Astronomics recommended mount for the 152 as the AVX would probably be overwhelmed by the 152..,0
A G-11 should do fine..,1
Could you please show more pics? Maybe with out the plastic?.,0
I see some Aston Martin grey under that plastic.  Beautiful....,0
We will take more images and post them when we physically have the scope in hand. The image above was sent by the manufacturer to let us know the 92 was being packed for shipment..,2
"Okeedokee, thanks for the reply gentlemen. Can't wait!!.",0
"I know this has been covered. But I am wondering , I already have the Astro tech field flattener for f/6 to f/9 refractor, does anyone know if it will work with the new At 92 and my Atik 420 camera? It has a small sensor. I think it is a 7 mm sensor..",0
"Aw, it's super cute! I hope it isn't too hard to make. I'm a little worried about how difficult it was to get the prototype to a high optical standard..",0
"should I get one? I *might* get the AP 92 mm, don't know, one never does, but I was not rejected from THE LIST. And I have a 92 cff on order. If I got the AT, it would be a trifecta. GN.",0
Go for it. Would love to read your side-by-side-by-side review..,0
"I am looking forward to seeing the AT92. From my experience having products manufactured offshore, I am less concerned about the quality of the prototype and the telescopes in the first production shipment than subsequent shipments that won’t have as much scrutiny from Astronomics. For this reason, I would like to see Astronomics start including test reports with each scope as some others do now, and I would be willing to pay the increased cost.. I am also concerned about having ongoing access to service and spare parts for the more expensive imported scopes, such as the AT92. If my $469 AT72EDII goes into the landfill in a few years because I can’t get spare parts or service, I won’t be pleased, but I won’t lose much. Not sure I am willing to pay $1,800 for an scope without an assured source of service and spare parts after the warranty expires, especially considering that ongoing service and spare parts are still available for my $400 imported Dob years after the warranty has expired..",0
Astronomics have already stated they will not provide reports with their scopes..,0
"Yes, I am aware of AT’s current position on test reports, understand why they are taking their position, and I can sympathize with them, but times change. Some of their competitors are starting to successfully differentiate their imported telescopes by offering test reports and more local service to avoid competing head to head on price. As the cost of the test equipment declines and (if) test reports become the expected norm, they might reconsider. Tak and AP have the market power to resist, others not so much.. I have been doing business with Astronomics for many years and continue to buy most of my gear from them. The AT72EDII that I own, and the AT72ED that I owned before are good products at a great price, high value, but I am willing to pay a bit more to get a bit more, especially for the more expensive imported scopes, and I encourage Astronomics to get on board and lead this trend rather than resisting it..",0
"Perhaps they could guarantee a minimum strehl or something.. I can understand on cheaper scopes but this is starting to get up there in money. Some kind of optical assurance besides a return policy is likely warranted.. Also, scopes like this are legitimately hard to make. Even the Tak sky 90 doesn't always have a great reputation.",0
I think they mentioned the target strehl of the AT92 in a previous post.. AP are not cheap but they provide no report either. Neither do TEC. Have an AP 130GTX and TEC140 neither came with reports. I honestly think Nelson getting his eye back is more likely than most vendors providing reports..,1
what about Moshe Dayan getting his eye back.,1
For that you need the zygo..,0
"Vague recollections..... The AT92 would have a minimum strehl of95. [Whether this was a 'guarantee', I don't know.]. Astronomics would send you a test report on your scope, but only after 6 months.. Of course, I could be wrong on both counts, but if so, I'm sure I will be quickly corrected.. Alex.",0
"I believe Mike said the target strehl for the AT92 is 0.95, which seems to be the target for other importers too, some of whom offer written reports with each scope. Mike reported the prototype that just shipped from the manufacturer meets the target. Don't know whether Astronomics has access to the test equipment required to duplicate/confirm the manufacturer's claims when they receive the prototype though.. From having electro/mechanical/optical gear manufactured offshore myself, I know it's always a challenge to get consistent quality, which is defined as conformance to specification. The prototypes might meet spec and the first batch of production scopes might meet spec, but later batches often don't get the same scrutiny from either the manufacturer or the importer and quality can start to decline unless you invest in a solid quality control system.. When I ordered my AT72ED, Mike said they were no longer inspecting and testing each scope because previous batches were very consistent. When I received my AT72ED2 last fall, I saw no evidence that the package had been opened and the contents inspected at Astronomics, but it's possible that it was opened, inspected, tested, and then repackaged. In any case, I have no complaints about either scope.. I will be interested to hear how Astronomics plans to handle the AT92 because it's a much more expensive scope that I believe might be inherently a bit more difficult to manufacture to consistently high quality..",0
I have the TMB92SS and its excellent most folks who have the 92SS and 130SS wont part with them. Production on a higher priced scope was very consistent.. APM and SV (who do a delay) are the only vendors providing reports I don't see it as a ground swell..,0
Guess you forget about ES?.,0
"Time will tell whether it becomes a ground swell. A few years ago nobody was offering test reports, just vague, lame assurances of “diffraction limited” performance, but the cost of the test equipment is declining, it’s more widely available, customers are requesting reports (me for example), and more manufacturers and importers are using them as part of their manufacturing, quality control, or marketing strategies. (Think ES is another one you didn’t mention).. A search of CN posts about SV refractors will show that the availability of a test report was often mentioned as a factor in the OPs purchase decision. It’s certainly a factor in mine these days.. Furthermore, importers who are still resisting this emerging trend trend to provide detailed, written test reports are starting to tout the design strehl for their products. For example, Astronomics is touting 0.95 strehl for the AT92, not documenting it yet, but they are on a slippery slope.. Will Tak or AP ever get onboard? Who knows, but they don’t need to get on board because these are the apex telescope manufacturers; merely putting these names on a scope is sufficient ensurance of a sensibly perfect refractor for many knowledgeable buyers. These manufacturers have market power, which is an important difference.. Does a vague assurance of diffraction limited performance from unknown Chinese manufacture have the same credibility? Nope, not a chance, but I own four scopes from manufacturers falling into this category, two of them from Astronomics. However, none cost more than $500, which is a very important factor.. Would I buy a 92mm scope for $1,800 from the same manufacturer without a written test report documenting its quality? Maybe, but it would be a tough sell because for $1,800 I can buy other similar scopes from similar manufacturers that come with a written test report. Or, I can purchase 3” Tak refractor for the same $1,800 or 4” Tak refractor for $2,200 from Astronomics with confidence that it will be sensibly perfect, and it will come with lifetime service, technical support, and spare parts provided through Tak’s master distributer, TNR. For $1,800, which would you buy?.",0
"I have the TMB92SS, TAK 106EDXIV, TAK FC-100DL and on the list for the AT92. Also have the AP130GTX and TMB140 #500. Did a report factor into any of the purchases? Nope absolutely zero, knowing how to do a visual and star test helps remove many of the concerns. Also don't SV have a delay before you can request the report?. Good luck with it but I honestly don't see vendors signing up for it. It would be more of a problem for vendors with folks chasing the his scope is better than mine return cycle. Also unless your buying a custom made scope most aremade inChina. I could see boutique vendors providing reports but they are way outside the AT92 price.. There's nothing to stop a user from sending their scope out to an independent test center get it tested. If its that much of a concern that option has always been there.. There is software on the market you could purchase that would let you run a series of tests on the optical train, with your CCD or DSLR attached..",1
"A test report comes with each scope, however it stays in house with us. This will be our verification of optical quality..",5
"So can this scope be used for visual? With a 2"" and or 1.25"" Diagonal?.",0
Should be fine with either..,1
That works for me..,1
"Phil,. As I said above, Tak and AP are apex manufacturers, so most knowledgeable buyers could purchase one of their telescopes and feel reasonably confident that the scope that was delivered to them would be sensibly perfect. I did, and my expectations were met, so it doesn’t surprise me that you did too. However, I would prefer a test report with a Tak or AP scope too, but don’t consider it essential for products of this caliber.. If so, why would I prefer a test report with Tak and AP too? Most anyone can star test well enough to decide whether a telescope is good or bad during the return period IF the weather, and work and family schedules cooperate, but confidently determining whether a telescope “sensibly perfect” as opposed to merely “good” is a more difficult task and perhaps beyond the ability of someone who hasn’t owned a sensibly perfect telescope before, and it’s more dependent on good seeing or good test equipment, such as an artificial star or the gear you mentioned to confirm the scope meets expectations.. I believe that I have enough experience star testing to seperate the sensibly perfect from the merely good, but I might not have enough free time or suitable weather during the return period to finish my testing, and might have a problem returning the scope after the return period if it doesn’t meet expectations.. However, even with a test report from Tak, AP, or anyone else, i would still do my best to confirm the report by testing the scope myself by whatever methods were available to me, but I would want to be reasonably confident that the scope will perform to the sensibly perfect standard before I invest my time testing the scope. A written test report would give me more confidence that I wouldn’t be wasting my time, and so would Tak or AP painted on the tube.. No, Stellervue is one of the importers that provide a test reports with the scope when it ships. However, this a $50 charge for the report with there least expensive scopes, but I would gladly pay the extra cost, and other CN members report doing so. BTW, I have confirmed this policy with SV and one of their larger distributors, and I would like to see Astronomics adopt a similar policy, not merely assure me that the prototype achieved 0.95 strehl unless they are selling me the prototype.. Astronomics has an excellent and well deserved reputation for delivering good to very good products with all the latest features the market wants at the lowest cost, which is exactly what the Astronomics delivered too me. For $369, the AT72ED was a good product, and for $469 the AT72EDII is a very good product, so my expectations were met, but the AT92 costs almost four times as much.. At $1,800, the AT92 is a much more expensive small scope, edging into sensibly perfect price territory, so I expect sensibly perfect performance. For example, Astronomics will sell me an FC76Ds for the same $1,800 or an FC100DC for $2,200.. Alternatively, I can buy another, larger scope for less money from another importer of chinese scopes that provides a written test report with each scope documenting a minimum 0.95 strehl. For example, a SV102A sells for about $1,100.. Unlike you, given the competition at this price point, I wasn’t willing to preorder the AT92 without evidence that TB returned from the grave to colaborate wth RC about the design, and Astronomics’ unidentified chinese manufacturer can consistently produce these scopes to 0.95 strehl.. For the moment, this is all hypothetical because Astronomics hasn’t seen the protoype yet, and we don’t know for sure whether this scope will go into production. Nor do we know what claims or guarantees Astronomics will make about its performance, or how they will ensure these claims are met in production, or how they intend to document these claims if at all.. Given the all uncertainty, I will probably wait a few years to see what shakes out, much like I did with the AT72ED, or I might just might buy one of the Taks Astronomics sells and be done with it. I also put my name an the AP92 list early the first day. If AP gives me a call, I will have a decision to make (declined AP130 when AP called last spring). In the meantime, I have other scopes to use, so see no reason to make a hasty decision that relies on good luck rather than good information.. Gary.",0
"Mike,. I have a couple of questions:. 1. Do you have an interferometer inhouse to confirm the validity of the manufacturer’s reports if only on a sample basis?. 2. If I buy an AT92, and I give you a quarter for the copier, will you send me a copy of the test report from the manufacturer?. Gary.",0
"We trust their Zygo report.  We have had interferometers in the past that were built for us, but didn’t see the need for one due to the consistent quality of the lenses.  Our interferometer now resides at Explore Scientific.  We will not send out any reports for a quarter, or the $100 it costs us for the sheet of paper on the 92 to guarantee they meet the quality that Tom Back and Roger Ceragioli intended, but I will be happy to post everyone we receive on our new site so they can be seen by all.  I have nothing to hide, but I have been down the road of Zygo envy with the original TMB line and have zero wish to go down that road again.",6
"Also, we have done business with this manufacturer for over a decade buying thousands of scopes from them. I see no need to not trust the work they have done.",1
"And to be fair we sell scopes that cost 3 times as much as the AT92 currently in the RC line as well as TMB 130s that were twice as much. Meeting our goals hasn't been an issue. Sometimes it takes longer to get there, but good things come to those who wait..",3
"Mike,. Thanks, you have provided good additional info, but it really didn’t answer my questions. i doubt you would employ a vendor you didn’t trust anymore than I would, but my experience having tens of thousands of widgets per month manufactured offshore has taught me to trust, but verify because even the most diligent, competent, and trustworthy vendor can have a bad day or a piece of test equipment go out of calibration or the equipment’s operator can screw up.. Getting back to my original questions that will help me to decide whether to purchase an AT92:. 1. Do you have an interferometer in house that’s capable of duplicating your trusted vendor’s test and confirming his report should you choose to do so?. 2. If I buy an AT92 and pay you for a copy, will you send a copy of the manufacturers report to me along with the scope?. If you consider this information too proprietary and don’t want to answer or would prefer to answer by private message please let me know.. Thanks. Gary.",0
I actually answered directly above the post you quoted.,0
"Mike,. Sorry, I didn’t see this answer before repeating my questions. I would appreciate the opportunity to review the posted test reports for all the AT92s, and I am sure many of your other customers would too. Thank you for offering.. Understand you have a business need to protect Astronomics proprietary information, which you must balance against my need to gather the information necessary to make a wise purchasing decision. It will always be that way, no getting around it.. I also understand the manufacturer has fixed and variable costs associated with the Zygo machine and these costs are much more than a quarter, but I assume these costs are passed on to you and the purchase price that I would pay for the AT92 reflects these costs already. It’s clear that you would have additional costs for providing copies that exceed the cost of the copy paper, but assume these additional costs can’t be much, and I am willing to compensate you for these additional costs, so assume your reluctance (have zero wish to go down that road again) is based on reasons other than cost, but not because you have something to hide.. Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions on Memorial Day. Really enjoying my AT72EDii, and I will probably buy a Tak from you if I don’t buy an AT92.. gary.",0
"Nothing worth doing is easy. If it’s a great scope, few will care that it took a bit longer than expected to reach production.. Understand that you already sell some much more expensive scopes than the AT92, but to me, $1,800 is a lot of money to pay for any scope, especially a 92mm scope from an unknown Chinese manufacturer, so i am asking hard questions, looking for the hard evidence that the quality of this scope is commensurate with its cost. It’s just due diligence, so please don’t take offense..",0
"Be nice to try it out. But it is close to my AT102 that i have and cost 3 times as much just about. I am hoping you guys come up with something like a lighter weight 5"" doublet ED in the F/8 or F/9 range for around $1300 to $1800 one day. Or even a 140mm F/8 ED. The AT102 ED is the best bang for the buck for my taste and seeing a bigger brother to the AT 102 ED like say a 5"" F/9 ED would be fun..",0
I wouldn’t say the scope from an unknown manufacturer. I have stated in the past it comes from the same company that produces our EDT line as well as the ED doublets.   So their quality is known.,1
We have a design for a triplet 141 that is based off our old 111.  We just decided to never push it through.,0
Cool and it stops the chasing numbers stupidity..,4
That's an interesting idea Mike. No way to link any report to a specific scope but would show how consistent the production run would be. 🤔,1
"The manufacturer is known to you, probably known to your competitors too, but unknown to me. I just know it’s someone you have faith in, and your judgement is usually good.. A few months ago, I believe you told me that the AT72ED2 was manufactured by a different company than the AT72ED, but didn’t identify the manufacturer. Which of these two manufacturers is doing the AT92? AT72ED or AT72EDII manufacturer?. What is your plan to offer service and support for the AT92 during and after the warranty period? For example, If I drop my AT92 and knock it out collimation after the one year warranty expires, how do I get my scope recollimated? Can you do it in the US, or does it have to go back to China to be repaired? How long does it take?. For another example, if I damage or loose a part from its focuser, which a CN member reported happening to his AT115ED, can you supply spare parts and for how long? CN member reports no spare parts were available for his AT115, but he had the equipment to fabricate his own parts, but I don’t.. These are important considerations for someone contemplating purchase of a $1,800 scope, less so for a $400-$500 scope.. Thanks. Gary..",0
"I would hope my judgement is better than ""usually good"" on products we bring in.. The service during the warranty period is up to us and dependent on how bad the issue is. Warranty on telescopes are for mechanical and optical issues. Collimation would not fall into the warranty issue unless it arrived out of collimation. If the scope could be fixed by push pull screws on the collar, it would make the most sense for the user to make the basic adjustment. If the cell is out of collimation we can fix it here if it pertains to the screws on the side of some of the cells that are produced. We also have a local gent that can get into the cell and fix it. I would say it would have to take quite a shot to knock a lens out of collimation. Length of repair could depend on how severe the issue is. As with any product, in any field, by any manufacturer it is impossible to put a timeline on a repair. This includes taking a car to a local mechanic. You can get a guess, but nothing rock solid.. The damaged parts on the 115 have now been addressed with our manufacturer and spare parts are on the way for future issues. As stated in that thread we have disabled perfect scopes to get parts, we just didn't have one to part out at the time.. Length of time is dependent on the supplier to us. Usually it isn't a problem for 3-5 years after production ends, which is pretty much industry standard. It may take some time to get parts if they are odd and need to come in with the next shipment from the manufacturer..",1
So here is the test report. This time in ajpg and not abmp..,4
1/6 wave ptv and over95 strehl. If this is average then it's tough to beat at this price range..,1
"Those are the specs we specified, so I believe this will be on average what you get. Could be a tad higher, but no lower..",2
"Michael,. Thanks for the info. Before I asked the question, I looked for this info on your website, but couldn't find any information about service, support, or spares for AT branded scopes.. I have been collimating newts for about 25 years, and I am very comfortable doing it, but never needed to touch a refractor, but from what I see posted on CN, it's not unheard of though for refractors to get knocked out of collimation, and the more elements, the more susceptible, but don't know whether this is true.. From what I have read, a doublet that has a fully adjustable lens cell can be collimated at home if the owner is brave and has the right tools. Triplets are reported to be much more difficult to collimate, and not a good candidate for do it yourself collimation. Haven't done it myself, so can't say.. Is the AT92 a doublet or a triplet? Is the lens cell adjustable? In any case, it's not something I would want to do, so I am glad that Astronomics can provide this service.. Pleased to hear that you are taking steps to stock spares for the AT115EDT. It's one of the scopes I am considering. Assume your will be also stocking parts for the AT92, and my AT72ED2 as well.. FYI, I just received an order some spare parts from Orion for a $300 Dob that's 15 years old. Took 48 hours. That's one of the reasons Orion Dobs cost a little more, but it's worth it to me.. A baseball player that bats500 walks on water. Nobody bats 1000. ""Usually good"" implies more than 50% of the time, but short of always, so it's a compliment :-). Regarding, your AT92 manufacturer, you said it's the same vendor that did your ED & EDT products. Which ED manufacture, AT72ED or AT72ED2? I am asking because you told me these scopes, both EDs, are made by different firms.. Thanks. Gary.",0
"I wonder if there would be any demand for a slower 5"" doublet ED or even a 140mm?.",0
Do you have info on the wavelength the test was done at? Thanks!.,0
"Good morning Michael,. Just wanted you to know I have a call in with the Pope. I am asking that you be declared a saint. I have compiled the necessary evidence from this thread. You should be a shoe-in. I will keep you posted.. john (fyi not to be confused with Pope John).",2
"Geez, does this mean that now every time I go in there I have to kiss his ring?.",1
LOL,0
"If Mike's the pope, what does that make Frebie?.",1
"He's not the Pope, he's a saint.  Saint Michael the Patient",2
"Hi Mike,. From AT92 page,. Is AT92 design incorporating flattening field as part of design parameters (even without flattener in place)?. Just curious.. Thanks.. Tammy.",0
I will need to look at that as it doesn't have a flattener built-in. I might be a remnant from a previous piece of work that was missed in the copy when constructing the information. Thanks for bringing that up to us..,0
19” extended. 16” collapsed 7.25 pounds. Push pull collimateable cell.,12
"And we put it against our TMB 92 we have in house with some quick optical comparisons and it was up to the task, if not a tad better from our brief time..",3
Absolutely gorgeous! Good job..,1
"It's so fresh, not even time to put the logo on. lol.",0
Can you tell us the scope of your “quick optical comparison?”.,0
"The original TMB 92 we have here was the scope.. The type of comparisons were artificial star test, Zeiss Optical test pattern chart, as well as our USAF test patterns.. They help with contrast and sharpness as well as the charts help with field curvature analysis. Nothing outside yet as we got it in the middle of the day and it is overcast with a chance of rain the next few days. So it could be a while until we get it outside..",0
"Thanks Mike, but how about a shot of the most important part, the objective end. Will there be a logo or not?.",0
Once the full on production scope makes it here there will be a logo and and engraved lens cell..,0
Here is the front.,1
"Thanks. I need to tool up to do the same thing. Is the artificial star a commercial product? If so, what’s the manufacturer/model?.",0
pm sent.,0
Thanks for the pictures Mike. I look forward to acquiring one..,0
"Great looking instrument. Is that a rotary lock-up at the 2"" visual back?.",0
Thanks for the weights. Is the 7.25 pounds you mentioned with the rings and dovetail as pictured or just OTA?.,0
It is..,0
OTA only. I will weigh the rings and DT when I get into the office tomorrow..,0
Excellent! That's about all I use these days. An excellent grip on the diagonal nose and less tedious than thumbscrews..,0
Any idea of availability? Yeah I know patience was never one of my strengths..,0
Looks like a sawed off version of my AT 102 ED..,0
That scope looks like a beauty. I'm very interested. I love the white and grey scheme. Short compact length could fit nicely in my photo backpack.....,0
Not yet.  We had this piece to make sure everything was in the up and up.  With the grey anodize I know all the mechanics are finished as they wouldn’t do a one off just for testing.  I have a feeling it is closer than I think.,2
Wow! It's beautiful! Can't wait to see the production model..,0
Any updates?.,0
"Ah, very exciting. Not sure anymore when I ordered, but Iam sure that it will prove to have been worth the wait.",1
Friendly bump. :-).,0
?????? 3 rd quarter Maybe by Christmas.,0
"The manufacturer expects completion by the end of August/first week in September. Boat shipment, customs, and motor freight to us take about a month. So, the good Lord willin' and the crick don't rise, the 92's should start shipping sometimes in October..",7
Good Christmas presents!!!!.,0
Do we have final specs? I do apologize if it's already been posted elsewhere. Really looking forward to seeing this one arrive!.,0
"I haven’t pre-ordered this one yet, the AT8CC is scratching a larger itch. Any updated news on when these arrive or is October still the plan?.",0
See post #256..,0
How much back-focus will the scope have? Seeing if it would be binoviewer-friendly w/o using an GPC..,0
"According to Mike's email today:. ""...is going through final QC and getting ready to be loaded on a ship in the next few weeks..."". So I'm thinking we'll be closer to October/November. The details that have been added to the product page are very exciting, though! I am ready for mine to come to its new home",0
Maybe i will try one of these for visual since the SW150 is off my list for a few months..,0
The product page I'm seeing seems to be the same one that has been up for a year. Am I missing something? Looking forward to updated details. An earlier post from Mike a week or two ago seemed to indicate early October. My luck that I'd probably be off at a star party the week it arrives!. Alex.,0
I still feel like this could be the ultimate travel scope. And the focuser wouldn't need to be upgraded either. It looks like a refined package that can easily fit into a photo-backpack. Color scheme is great too..,0
I think a lot of folks are hoping you're right!.,0
Next year??!. I thought I was told this fall... Maybe I did not hear correctly.,0
"I don't think anyone mentioned next year. (Some of us have been patiently(?) waiting a year). Our sponsor's latest estimate was this October, I believe. October is my clearest month of the year, so very much looking forward to the scope's delivery. Of course, that might mean I get a rainy October too!. Alex.",0
"No, I'm sure you're not missing anything. I bought in right at the beginning, and haven't visited the product page in a very long time. My math on predicting timing is like this: Current date 8/9 - ""shipping in a few weeks"" = 1st week of September - Boat from China = 1 month, so 1st week of October - Port & Customs receiving, then ship to Astronomics from West Coast 2 weeks = 3rd week October - unpacking, inspection, re-packing = one week rolling through received inventory. Then shipping UPS ground process = 2 weeks total, ending with delivery 2nd week November.. That's my over/under",0
They need a 25 knt ship..,0
"Hey there, Chas. I'm picking up what you're putting down there I also think this one's going to be the one. Crazy mag levels. We'll see soon enough..",0
Long-time owner of a TMB 92L here. Excellent performance and a nice size for my aching back. I think those waiting on the new one will be pleased..,1
Yes I would not swap my TMB92L for anything..,1
"I have a CFF 92 f/6.9 on order that's supposed to come in round about the times mentioned here, would be interesting to do a comparo. But I know from previous experience that for my preferences an f/5.5 delivers too much on the low end (field of view) and not enough at the high end. I know because f/6.3 is a little too fast to my taste.. Supposedly the AP 92 mm is also slated to ship this fall (what I heard round about here) but I don't believe it. I know someone who has the old AP 92mm so I'll be able to do a comparo with that. But curious though I may be I don't see myself getting one of these. I'm worried that if I do Astro-physics will actually notify me and then I'll have three 92 mm apos.. Greg N.",1
Anyone?.,0
"I'm fine with the faster focal ratio. I do plan on comparing my AP Traveler to the AT92, no expectations going in. Should be fun, even given the Traveler's larger 105mm aperture..",0
"If you look at the product page, there is a diagram showing how much back focus will be available.. https://www.astronom...ota_p20545.aspx.",0
"As much as I'd like one of these scopes, my time with the 90/500 Borg 90FL left me sure of one thing, and that's that I don't want to drop 2 grand on a scope with that much star blur in the outer field ever again. Maybe I'm exaggerating even to myself, but the field curvature + fast FR meant that half the field was out of focus at any given time, maybe 40% of the field was out of focus. But it was hard to ignore. I think a slower focal ratio would have done the trick. Somehow I don't see as much of it in my 72/432 AT72EDII at f/6 instead of f/5.6. It's strange to me because f/5.6 isn't that much faster than f/6, and 432mm over 500mm means it has more field curvature. Yet somehow I just don't notice it as much... a visual extender/flattener would sweeten this scope for me but that won't happen. Well, at any rate, I look forward to reading the impressions of others. Only a few months away now!.",0
"Well it will be interesting to see how it turns out. It certainly is the case that f/6 to f/6.3 is about as fast as a number of expert designers have wanted to go, leaving the rest to some combination with a reducer/flattener or a Petzval type construction.. But there was an f/4.9 Astro-physics 92 mm so perhaps the f/5.5 isn't so ambitious after all. Difficult, that is, but not unprecedented. Then there was an f/7 doublet, and then the f/6.6 AP 92. The C7 page says the f/4.9 was ""too short"" without going into a lot of details on what ""too short"" means.. I would say that given the prevalence of astigmatism in people's eyes that the faster you go for visual use the fewer the number of people who can take advantage of the wide field due to the increasing side effects of user astigmatism. You can think of it as a diminishing return to field of view. I don't think AP ever went back into the f/5 zone but I haven't memorized their product line the way some have. On the other hand for photographic use if all the other optical issues are tended to it could be very good indeed.. But it seems like AP backed away from f/4.9 and that most of the other fast refractors hovered in the low to mid 6's. This would include my Vixen ED102SS f/6.5 and my SV4 LOMO 102 triplet f/6.4. GN.",0
"This scope is attractive on its face but at f/5.5, it would probably be too fast for this visual observer. I have found that the TV-85 is a nearly perfect balance between wide field views and enough focal length to take a little power. Magnification isn't as big a deal to me not being a serious planetary or DS observer. That said, I do hope this thing gets released soon as it looks great and should fill a lot of amateurs' requirements for a portable scope..",0
"Similar to AT92, SkyWatcher Esprit 100mm is f/5.5. I know people had taken good images with it. Wondering if there are people using it for visual..",0
"Looking forward to making the same comparison.  It should be fun!. Regarding the worries about field curvature, at ~500mm focal length, given that this is a remake of the TMB92, what were the reports/complaints about its FC? Even the Traveler is a short f/5.8. Alex.",1
"150mm is borderline for even the shortest binoviewer setups. A Baader Maxbright with a T2 prism diagonal is 148mm (110 for the binos, 38 for the diagonal). Some eyepieces may come to focus, but most probably will not..",0
I gotta wonder if this scope is too fast for visual? FC bothers me..,0
"Referring to my previous post, the AT92 is a reissue of the TMB92, with some refinements. Were there a bunch of complaints about its field curvature? Googling ""TMB92 field curvature"" turns up little.. TMB92 f/5.5 owners, what has been your experience?. Alex. PS, I'm only interested in visual, but others I'm sure are interested in imaging, where I imagine a FF is advised..",0
I do know that FC does not bother me with my AT102ED at F/7 nor did it bother me with my TMB 105/650 at F/6.2. But it bothers me with SCT's..,0
"Based on my experience with the Traveler visually, I'm not really worried. Admittedly I do a lot of EAA so there you have it - but I also love to throw the smaller OTA's on the T-Rex and groan it out to the driveway for some visual astronomical congress",0
Even with a Meade 5000 80mm APO and a 13mm Ethos FC did not bother me. But i sure notice it in SCT's..,0
"Yeah, I have to say pretty much the same. I can't claim to know the why's and wherefore's of that, but I have divested myself of all my SCT's. Still, I am lusting over one of those Astronomics 10"" carbon fiber truss rod RC's... oh yeeeessss I am- so not all catadioptrics are off the list....",0
Just thought I'd check in. Are our scopes on the boat yet? Alex.,0
I hope they are and the slow boat gets bigger engines to make more speed..,1
"Well, testing the scope in house a plethora of eyepieces from various manufacturers came to focus using two different diagonals (a 1.25"" and a 2""). So no worries here with visual work. Binoviewers are a different animal however. I can't speak on those..",1
"They are getting loaded in a container with the 115EDTs, 72EDs, and some other goodies..",3
"Mike, with the AP Stowaway delivery frustration...you are going to get plenty of takers for this!.",0
Yippee !!!! Early Christmas I will just consider it a retirement present from my most beautiful and awesome wife.. Thanks for the update Mike.,0
"Mike, is there a plan to make dedicated flattener for AT92?. Looking forward to side-by-side comparison between TMB 92SS and AT92, maybe with AP92 (or Stowaway) as well if I am lucky enough to have it next year.. Tammy.",0
We will look at one in the near future.  The AT2FF should work decently for a stop gap since it worked with the TMB.,0
Will the Astronomics field flattener for F 9- f6 work with the 92 triplet?.,0
"Thanks, Mike. That would work. I have AT2FF already. So I am all set for now.. Tammy.",0
Cool..,0

"Well if my Panos and, Radians, Delites, and Nags, as well as a 2"" 30mm 82 degree ES all come to focus i am all set. I just hope FC won't be a problem. At F/6 and slower it seems to be ok to my eyes. This could be my Stowaway on the cheap..",1
"At 0.95 Strehl, which seemed to be difficult to get the manufacturer to hit based on the failed tests documented in this thread - no it wont be..",0
"If the failed tests are the norm, rather than the path to spec compliance, maybe you're right. In the meanwhile, you're engaging in speculation like everyone else.  Nothing wrong with that, I guess..",0
"Its not speculation. I used the data in thread to make that comment. How is that speculation?. Meanwhile, the test data from the subject the poster commented on (AP Stowaway) is showing over 0.99 Strehl. To say that one the same yet on the cheap is completely false. No speculation required. Just look at the data..",1
"Of course it's speculation. Boy, if I had a dollar for every time a test unit came back with reported99 Strehl... but it's Roland, so okay I'm in. And I mean that sincerely.. How many AT test units have you measured? Test data is just that - test data. Test results are one indicator, and worthy of consideration, but they are not necessarily a guarantee of the ultimate outcome. If you think that test samples give you everything you need to know about production units, you may be right - but probably (and historically) not when measuring yields from unit to unit.. Define ""on the cheap"". Are you familiar with the fab and assembly process? The ATP? The QTP? My expectation is that Roland will produce superior product. As an AP owner, I also know that Roland is not the sole producer of said superior product, and he will be the first to tell you so.. Wait for production units, and test them. Until then, it's speculation. Maybe educated speculation, but still speculation..",1
"Its not speculation. Its a comment based on the data provided. Moreso its a comment based on the repeated misses for the mark they asked for. Its not me perpetuating some false narrative, they quite literally shared that with everyone reading this and I assume for good reason.. How many AT units of the 92 has anyone other than Astronomics tested? None. Asking me that question is a complete waste of anyones time on this thread..",0
"I disagree. I get that you have some passion behind your position, and you may have noticed that I haven't excluded the possibility that you may be proven correct. What I have done is call you out on using preliminary data (that's what we call it in engineering) to determine an absolute outcome. You simply don't know, and you are making a prediction - which is, by definition, speculation.. And on a personal level, please don't dictate to me what may or may not be a waste of time for the people on this forum. They get to make that call, and I don't appreciate the implication. For the record, my question comes from ISO standards for engineering and quality practice, and it's anything but a waste of time. Let's keep it respectful and civil..",1
I think FC will bother me at F/5.5 I notice it pretty easy in my Pano set at F/6..,0
"When I see a statement like "".. Stowaway on the cheap"" I don't immediately jump to the idea that the scope is exactly the same optically (Strehl99 etc.). Instead I think that it may offer a similar experience - quality optics, compact design, suitable for travel. Whether or not the AT92 offers enough practical optical quality is still to be determined. If I felt that the manufacturer wasn't going to learn from the early samples I might be more concerned.. but assuming that they have I think we have a reasonable expectation that the full product version will be better..",0
I have a cut off point of what i will pay per inch. I was never the kind to pay AP prices when a cheaper scope can get you 85% of the way there vs paying triple for that last 15%..,0
"To be fair if the scope was f/6.65 the strehl number wouldn't be as difficult to hit, but they have hit the number we spec'd and we will have data on hand for each unit proving it.. The old TMB 92 had no such data and was compared very favorable to the f/7 stowaway.. The AT92 demo unit will be at the Okie Tex star party, so if anyone happens to be there they can get a first look..",8
"Calling it failed tests if pretty out there. People asked and I informed them of the state of the project. I could have lied and said everything was okay. Instead I kept it transparent and said it was taking more time than we anticipated as we had a fast lens with a fairly high spec.. It is a great time to be able to get an AP, if you have been on the waiting list for a bit, or if you wish an AT which has been under construction for 13-14 months..",10
"I think most folks do too, although I'll bet most don't articulate it that directly.. I also really didn't want this thread to devolve into an AT92 vs AP Stowaway thread.. I don't think that would really benefit anyone..",2
"I applauded the transparency. I'm keeping an eye on these as well. As for the AP I was on the new list within minutes after it went live. Unfortunately I did not sign up 19 years ago, so I'll be waiting a bit longer.",0
"If you can, see how the AT92 does with FC for visual. It would be a visual only scope for my use..",0
"Well said. You had the courage to inform everyone of work in progress, which not everyone would do. And you made it clear back then that you were working to improve further to hit your target performance. It's a bit of a shame that some are using data from a product in development to predict the performance of the final product, especially at this kind of price/performance ratio.. Not to mention the fact that the initial test unit came in at 0.946.. this is incredibly close as it is. Within 99.5% in fact.. and what is the accuracy of the Strehl test anyway? (Every scientific test has a degree of error/accuracy.. many of them higher than you might think!). So I fully agree, calling this a failed test is pretty harsh - round that to two decimal places, you've hit your target already. But you had the honesty not to do that, and the perseverance to take the extra time and achieve your goal.. Alas, my problem still remains (convincing my accountant to approve purchase).. in the meantime, I look forward to living vicariously through the reports of those who have been patiently waiting for their pre-orders!",3
"Time for another bump.. Matt, I thought your estimate was somewhat pessimistic, but it feels like the boat may be taking a scenic route, so it's looking like you may be right!. Alex.",0
"Alex,. Having been through it with the 130 EDT, it seemed a pretty reasonable estimate     Blink and it will be here!",1

"What was the total product run of Stowaways? How many were tested by independent lab that revealed99 strehl? Was it polychormatic strehl or simply one wavelength? Just trying to understand if we have a statistically valid sampling to make an assertion that they are likely produced at this strehl, and if the strehl is extensible over the entire visible spectrum since I do not use narrow bandwidth color filters when observing..",0

Very nice thread on the AT 92. I suspect the scope is going to be where the Astro Tech scopes usually are. At the right end of Great Cost and Great performance. The AT 115 and AT 130 scopes I had both fit that and the AT 152 that currently sits in a large soft carry Tripod case awaiting clear skies and first light will also fit the bill. After all getting the open box Demo at $3395 was a great bargain. What amazes me the most is the honesty and integrity of Astronomics staff. They could have re-boxed the DEMO and sold it as new but they did not. That was just enough of a nudge to make me commit to this scope..,0
Use it and tell us how it is..,0
You live in Florida just like I do so I think if we get any time at all this weekend you will be among the first to know..,1
"I was tempted by a classifieds listing for an SV90TBV yesterday, and ultimately passed, but it got me thinking about the AT92 again. If it turns out that the TSFlat2 flattener that someone has mentioned will flatten the field with enough backfocus for a 2"" diagonal, without adding any aberrations, the AT92 would be a sweet setup. I am still looking forward to reading user reports.. And then, as I was thinking about it just now, I remembered the Astronomics contest to win a free AT92 by leaving reviews on their new site. I encourage you all to go check out the reviews - it seems somehow a bunch of people have already gotten this scope and used it enough to leave a review! Or, Astronomics is just asking people to leave a bunch of bogus reviews on their website whether you've even used a product they sell or not. Seems pretty low to me. I'll say that the reviews aren't auto-approved either; my review saying the other ones should be deleted was never posted.. Well, it's November... can't be too long now........",1
Looks cloudy and i got 2 scopes coming next week so there will be more clouds now..,1
So I can share the Blame with you that makes me feel much better  Actually we have a small window tomorrow night that I might jump at provided the weather cooperates..,0
"Have just got the prototype AT92. Still raining here in upstate NY, first clear night will get out for a visual report..",2
wow very nice  Looking forward to that......,0
"Really? I'd have thought Astronomics would keep it like they kept the prototype TMB92, for reference..",0
Astronomics has a history of selling final prototypes..,1
Interesting. Guess the TMB92 was an anomaly then!.,0
"I can only assume people are leaving reviews based on the TMB92 that this is based off. As I am a human that approves the reviews, when I batch approved a large chunk at a time they get through. I will look at them later today when I get a chance.. We have never asked people to leave bogus reviews, and to be honest I am offended you would even suggest it. The request for reviews has been identical in copy since I sent it out the first day..",9
"Mike, I didn't mean to offend, just criticize. The fact that any reviews for the AT92 have been approved is very disconcerting considering literally no one (except now Phil) has one. I know you can't realistically verify ownership but it's pretty obvious by the text in those reviews that the people don't own one. I see the reviews are now gone, so thanks. I just don't know why the reviews were ever approved in the first place. ""This will be a great scope, 5 stars!!"" doesn't mean anything to anyone who actually wants to know how it performs, not how it's expected to perform. Reviews like that and the fact they were allowed/approved lowers my confidence overall in the reviews on the platform, though there are some good reviews where it's clear the owner has some experience. But I digress.. I shouldn't have said that you seem to be asking for bogus reviews. What I really meant was that you seem to be OK with them because they were approved for display on the website, and that you are OK with those bogus reviews representing your product. If it's obvious in a review that the reviewer has never owned the item in question, it shouldn't be posted, IMO. It's just speculation at that point..",1
"Come on people, this is supposed to be a fun hobby.. I am waiting patiently for the arrival of the 92 triplet as are alot of others. For those of you who are skeptical about the quality of the product don't order one. I am sure that there are a lot of people that will take your place to get one.. Or you can wait to see the reviews of us that will receive one of the first batch.. Clear skies all. Mike.",4
"It is supposed to be fun! But what's not fun is having to decide whether to trust the opinions of others when it comes to gear impressions. None of those AT92 reviewers could have had any basis for reviewing it so not only should they not have posted a review but even more crucially, Astronomics should not have approved them (again because no one could have possibly had any experience warranting an accurate review). A prediction is not a review. A prediction is speculation.. Anyway, back to the fun side of astronomy - waiting! For clear skies, for new gear.",2
Yes indeed it is supposed to be fun. Now Phil has two of the Prototypes the AT 92 and the AT 152 I think he likes his Prototype refractors with even numbers......,1
I already explained that it was a batch approval on a new website. I am sorry I have been too busy working the site and trying to turn a profit to keep Cloudy Nights up and running as well as astronomics to go and check every single review of the 1000+ that have been submitted..,5
"And if you want a review that isn't speculation, as the AT92 has an ""improved"" design, feel free to read this from Sky and Telscope about the TMB 92..",1
"“jay.i” should apologize to Mike and the Astronomics crew. They have been extraordinarily transparent regarding the optics, the Strehl rejection threshold etc., much more so than most other manufacturers. I thank them for this transparency and hope it will prove to be an industry-wide trend..",4
"In the end keeping them just seems silly to me. If we were someone like Roland I could justify keeping my work. As I am not an optician, but a guy that knows opticians, it just doesn't fit my profile. I would rather people get their hands on them and use them. The only reason we have the TMB92 is that is it easy for my dad to lug out if wants. Same reason he has a 3.5"" Questar..",4
"I ask this only because I am lazy and don't want to read 14 pages of this thread, but is there a date when the production AT92s are to arrive? Have they all been spoken for yet? Thanks....",0
"There are some available.. They were suppose to ship in Aug/Sept with the 115s and 72s. However, I have not received shipping documents yet..",0
"Dear Jay....you are very often critical and nit picky  I thought the Borg was going to be perfect for you after all of your study of charts, graphs, interferograms blah, blah, blah and blah. Yes I follow this forum but never post about things I.....",2
"I'm sorry Astronomics, for holding you accountable for the way you run your website.. Thank you Mike for explaining it and taking corrective action.. You may all resume your ""how dare you criticize these kind people that provide telescopes at affordable prices you should be thankful they exist at all back in my day we didn't have anything like it"" diatribe. Heaven forbid someone be critical of something worth criticizing..",2
Uuuuf.......,3
We need pics..,0
So i can buy a AT92 right now?.,0
You can get on a list.  Phil has the only one in the states that isn’t a TMB.,1
"[quote name=""jay.i"" post=""8928938"" timestamp=""1541278393""]. I'm sorry Astronomics, for holding you accountable for the way you run your website. [quote]. A simple question would have got the same reaction that your accusation did.  Probably best to drop the entire thing and move on.",2
I won't mention it again. Thanks Mike..,0
I’ll get some pictures tomorrow. It’s been a hectic couple of weeks with travel for work and then sucky weekend skies.. Its a very well made scope. Just need to get out under the sky now. The new scope curse is strong with this one. Must be a good omen..,4
Congrats on getting the prototype!. Looking forward to your first light review.,0
Also want to say how awesome it is the Astronomics is giving one of these scopes away!,0
"Shhh.. the more people know about the competition and enter, the lower our chances of winning! ;P.",0
"Yesterday I saw the promotion to leave a review and be entered in the draw for an AT92. Since I obviously don’t have an AT92, I was going to leave a review of my AT102ed. I thought that made sense, since I actually own and have used the 102ed. I didn’t see anywhere that the review had to be about the AT92. Maybe I missed something.. That said, I was unable to log into my Astronomics account and gave up. I’ll try again today. It would be nice to be entered in the draw. Maybe I’d actually win something for once in my life before I kick the bucket..",0
Not all the accounts have been merged over as we had a date for a database cutoff. You may need to register again. We are working on bringing over all the accounts that were after the cutoff date and will merge them with any new accounts that have been set up..,2
"Thanks Michael, I will register again.. Am I off the mark that a review of my AT102ed would be acceptable to be entered in the draw?. Thanks.. Wade..",0
"We would like any product you have owned and used being reviewed, and it didn't need to be purchased from us. So yes, the 102 is a great choice to review. Thank you for taking the time to write one up.. There is no limit to the amount of reviews you can write about your gear..",2
I will review a 92 for free..,0
"I appreciate the offer, but this is for reviews on astronomics.com to help buyers become informed about their potential purchase. However, for every review you submit you get entered in the contest to win the 92..",0
"Do you receive additional chances to win for each review submitted? Cheers,. Shawn",0
You do. Every review is one chance in the give away.   So 10 reviews is 10 chances.,1
"Is the 92 on the slow boat with the new 6"" Cass scopes? When is the ship getting here?.",0
"Astronomics said yesterday, November 3rd.. ""There are some available"" (meaning they have not already been spoken for). ""They were suppose to ship in Aug/Sept with the 115s and 72s. However, I have not received shipping documents yet."".",1
Based on this I would say Customs is working on clearing the ships cargo for release to the shippers.....Will be nice to see the AT 92's.,0
I just gotta wonder if FC will bother me at this fast speed?.,0
"It's the focal length, not the focal ratio that's the bother for FC.",0
"You're right, focal length is the only thing that determines field curvature. However, the size of defocused stars will increase with a faster focal ratio, due to a shallower depth of field. This can make field curvature much more apparent as fast focal ratios - 500mm FL at f/8 will show much smaller defocused stars than 500mm FL at f/5.5. Most people just lump this effect under field curvature but there's more at play here..",1
I have a 90mm f/6.9 coming this week and i will see how it does. Some people say the lens was really a F/6.2 and was marked wrong by W/O. If i am not happy i will get the AT92. FC drives me nuts like coma does in a Newt..,0
will tomorrow night before pics..,0
"I had a TS72 F5.5 doublet apo. It was a quirky scope with its extension tube needed for various EP's but I wish I kept it because of my 2"" eyepieces now.. The scope's apparent FC varied with eyepieces and the observer. Some EP's were better than others. I remember using a 27mm pan in it to get almost all of Hyades one winter and it was absolutely beautiful and barely noticeable, where a 20mm Nagler T5 was more pronounced. My observing friend who is a bit older than I notices FC more than I do and is less tolerant of it.. Chas: you need to experiment with eyepieces to get the most out of a fast scope. Also, a smooth dual speed focuser is a must, which this scope will have. This scope will win for EAA, grab and go wide fields and color correction. Likely very good at planetary as well for inner planets if it has a good figure..",0
I don't see how FR is making FC more apparent. I'd think it would just be the depth of focus that differs. More defocus for a given amount of travel on the focuser for the faster scope. Not more field curvature..,0
All my Pano's gave a soft view at the field edge and i sold them. There were no better than my old Wide fields This was with the AT72ED. F/8 and slower they were fine..,0
Pano's? Like in Tele-Vue Panoptics? What other interesting equipment have you had? I sincerely hope you get a AT 92 I really think that is going to be an awesome grab and go scope.....,0
It's like bokeh; out of focus light sources increase in size based on the focal ratio and also the focus point (focus close means background gets blurry). Jon Isaacs had a good explanation for it a while back too. You're seeing an exaggeration of the out of focus areas due to field curvature the faster you go because even less is in focus.,0
I have about every thing under the sun. The Tele Vue Pano line was not a good match for my glasses. I figure i just as well have the older Wide fields for half the price. I just sold a set of 5 from the 15 to the 27mm. I am sure i will try a AT92..,1
I also don't like shallow focus on fast Newts..,0
Here's the AT92. Not the best pictures as taken with an iPad in the warm room/man cave.. Can only attach one as a time..,12
Second one..,8
Third one. Dew shield extended.,9
Last one. The back end..,8
"Mechanically, it looks very familiar (and that's a good thing). It's what's inside that I'm looking forward to most Oh, and P.S. - Thanks, Phil!.",0
I want it now..,1
I'm waiting for the skies to clear. Raining again. Will report when it clears.. Really does collapse down well for travel though.. Cheers. Phil.,3
Why am I not surprised?,1
Looks like a mini AT102ED..,0
Excellent photos that scope looks fantastic and thank you for the photos..,0
Thanks for the photos Phil! Looking forward to your reports and with what eyepieces you used.. Regards..,0
I can match your TV eyepieces. Will use a few in the review..,3
It’s so tiny! (Compared with my significantly longer 91Fl f/7.7).,0
Great pictures Phil! Can you please tell us how much does it weight?.,0
"Hi does the 2"" focus collar unscrew and if so what are the threads? Looking for how to couple this direct to a camera using threaded coupled extensions or camera adaptors!. Thanks,. Keith.",0
You have to see it next to the AT 152 EDT now that 92 is tiny next to my ( FracZilla  But ask Phil to picture them together you will see what I mean..,0
So the scopes have not arrived yet? Thanksgiving. Christmas or next year? Does anyone know? Not trying to be difficult but it would be nice to know..,0
"Man, y'all sure can get salty 'round these here parts at times! You surely realize that Mike does not control the supply base outside of whatever MOA he has for his orders. His volume can't be enough to influence product turn times. I do appreciate the anticipation and frustration as much as the next fella, but geez...",1
Asking for information if it is available is a legitimate question. I modified my original post as you can see..,1
"I am definitely looking forward to comparing this to my Traveler, maybe a little over/under config to see what's what..",0
"Fair enough, and I'm really trying tonot be the posting police.  I have way too much of a checkered past for that, myself. I do tend to defend Mike and company, though, given everything they do for this very small community. We need all the help and sponsorship we can get, IMO. 'Nuff said on my part on that subject..",2
I agree with you 100%..,1
8-12” of snow tonight. Now that is a heck of a scope curse..,0
"Looking forward to the same comparison here Matt, as well as with a TV-85.. Alex.",1
Fly to Florida the next few nights are going to be spectacular after the front gets out of here. I would love to see that AT 92 Prototypehttps://clearoutside...st/27.59/-81.45.,0
"As we (hopefully!) get closer to seeing these shipped, and more people get interested in this scope, just a friendly bump..",0
"It will be interesting how high of magnification this short focal length scope can take at 95% sterhl ratio.. My experience of 72mm fpl53 f5.5 shows that color correction can be amazing at low to mid power. They typically cant take as high of powers with shorter focal length eps as well as longer focal lengths. It is the trade off you pay for the shorter, more portable profile.. If it can take a 3.5 eyepiece(145x) well with very good contrast (on Jupiter for example) then this scope is winner in my book..",1
"Please forgive me for asking this, but I really don't want to wade through 400 plus messages to find the answer, when is this expected to become available? Is there a waiting list? I really want one! :-).",0
"There is a waiting list and has been for most of 2018. If you want one, the get on the list. If you want to get up-to-date information then I'd recommend that you call and speak to Astronomics and ask all the questions you would like..",0
"Thanks for letting me know, just sent them an e-mail asking about how to order and get on the waiting list. I really hope you're not the official spokesperson for these wonderful scopes as you are really grumpy. Most people here love helping out by answering questions. You're the first person I have encountered on CN to basically tell me to bugger off the thread instead of answering a poster's questions..",0
"No, he is not the official spokesman for these scopes, I am. I apologize for his grumpiness. There is a waiting list and has been most of 2018. If you want one then get on the list. If you want to get up to date information then I'd recommend you call and speak to Astronomics and ask all the questions you would like. There, now bugger on off..",3
"I am so sorry. I had no idea being an eager customer and asking questions could make people so unpleasant. It was definitely not my intention. Usually asking questions is a perfectly normal practice. Again, I am so terribly sorry. I was just excited and wanted to learn more. I did send Astronomics an e-mail (it was too late to call), but I will call tomorrow. This is the only thread I have ever encountered where one person asking questions was so actively discouraged. This is really confusing to me, is it because I am female? I really just don't understand, everyone else's posts in this thread are treated with respect. Again, I would like to apologize, I am so sorry for asking questions and for saying or doing anything that bothered anyone, I didn't know this thread had different rules than the others. Still new to the forums, will have to read the FAQ again. Really confused. :-(.",0
"The scope was announced in summer of 2017, and many of have been waiting since then. But the scope is expected to be shipping out soon, and the last post I saw from Astronomics said there were still some available in the first shipment So, your wait would be less agonizing than most.. Please let let us know when, and what, you here from Astronomics. This time of year, I'd think they would prefer one call, and then spread the word, rather than multiple calls from all of us. But here's hoping the wait is about over. Alex.",0
Your okay and I'm sorry about the confusion. Any time anybody asks a question about an AT scope Roger tells them to call Astronomics no matter what. If I had a nickel for every time I've seen him do it I could buy a new AT92 for cash. The next poster was just having a little fun hence the smiley face emoticon at the end of the post.. Mike.,0
"Sorry if my post came across as being grumpy and it certainly was not to tell you to bugger off and no I'm far from being an official spokesperson.. My post was intended to help you by suggesting that you speak to the vendor (Astronomics) that is responsible for the AT92 so that you wouldn't get swayed by opinions. By saying ""If you want one get on the list"" it was intended to mean, if you would like to get one, currently that is the only way you will be able to, by getting on the list. When I bought my AT130, they were out of stock so I had to get on that scope's list and when they arrived my scope was shipped out to me. Had I wanted one, and not placed my order to get on the list well I'd still be waiting today.. I am of the opinion that if you want to get information about shipping dates and specifications it is wise to speak to whoever is responsible for that and not get the opinion of what others think on a forum. Astronomics is a very reputable firm as are most astronomy based firms so they will give you as accurate of information as possible..",0
"Thank you Alex, you are so totally awesome! I'll let you know what I hear..",0
"Not a problem, sorry about any miscommunication, I'll give Astronomics a call to get on the list. I don't mind waiting, this should be an amazing scope and Astronomics has always been terrific. I purchased my first eyepiece from them decades ago, Mike is the best!.",0
I have the prototype and posted pictures of the scope in the thread. I can’t answer any questions on arrival dates. Being in the North East the weather has not cooperated apart from a quick look so far but things from short initial look have been positive. I might be able to answer some questions. As soon as the wearher gets back to above freezer levels and I get a clear sky I’ll get a viewing report.. Cheers. Phil.,2
I called a few days ago asking about my back ordered AT115EDT shipment date. I was told the AT115s are being shipped together with the AT92's and they would arrive in December sometime before Christmas but no firm date was given. So maybe 3 weeks if we are lucky? I was also told they prepare shipping labels ahead of time to speed up the turnaround but they will unpack and do some level of inspection of each scope. Then repack and ship. So that would add some time tot he process. But I personally think that would be time very well spent...John.,1
"Having also been through the process before with the 130 EDT introduction, I would advise patience I say that because (to the best of my understanding) -. No small wonder that they have to be somewhat general in their estimates for delivery of our new babies to our doors...",3
"agmoonsolns,.  I'm glad you are getting some answers to your original question. I wouldn't blame anyone for not wanting to read through 400 pages. I didn't think the first response was very friendly even though it had a somewhat sensible suggestion. I'm not on the list for this new AT 92 telescope, but I'm really looking forward to member's reports and pictures. It seems it will be very very nice. ps: I noticed you are recently registered to CN even though you have experience. Welcome to the refractor forum. Have you checked out the eyepiece forum.",2
If the ship info is known there is AIS. You can go to the vesseltracker site and slowly watch the ships progress. You would also drive yourself insane. It’s would be like watching someone jogging from China taking the long way round.. https://www.vesseltracker.com/.,0
"Hey, don't worry about it! You're not out of line at all.. Roger wasn't being grumpy - the world of buying and selling telescopes, and how they are developed and marketed, is still a bit old fashioned in some ways. You can have direct contact with the manufacturer, or at least primary vendor for an item. Sometimes you can even talk to the person who designed the thing you want to buy (like talking to the Nagler family at TeleVue). In the case of the AT92, the release date has been estimated a few times by Astronomics, and simple things like the weight still aren't on the product page. This community can't always agree on everything, and one case in which you can get the truth is if you have a question about a specific product from a vendor that is still alive and kicking.. In the case of the AT92, your best bet is just to straight up call Astronomics, the primary vendor/manufacturer of this scope. Roger wasn't being grumpy - he was just telling you, in a concise manner, that the best thing you can do to get answers to your questions is to go straight to the source. Sometimes there is a lot of unnecessary back-and-forth (""I saw this here"" and ""but I heard from so and so"") and you can skip all of that if you just call the vendor.. Please do ask any questions that come to mind - I think you'll find most people here just want to help. I know I do, even if I do come off grumpy sometimes. I'll shamelessly self promote my guide to understanding, using, and choosing refractors. It might not answer all of your questions, you might know everything in it already, but just in case it helps, here you go!.",0
"😂. my opinion, and it’s worth exactly what you paid for it, is that No One, not even Astronomics knows, with certainty, when the AT 92s will arrive.. The best way to find out when the AT 92s Have arrived is to watch Cloudy Nights Refractors forum and wait for someone to post “the AT 92s have arrived! “. Then you will know they are here..",0
"Exactly when did you state that you were female? It was after you became upset and wanted everyone to feel SO sorry they didn't treat you better, right? Or was that when you BECAME a female?.",2
"I chose to ignore that piece of information because it is irrelevant, even if she disclosed that information intentionally for some reason. Either way I think we can say that gender discrimination has nothing to do with the matter-of-fact tone some people take here, which I explained was not intended to sound grumpy anyway. The internet will not always hold your hand... heck, you've got to have a little thick skin to get by in today's world whether it be online or offline..",3

Ok weight I read with rings and dovetail is 8.8# for the prototype..,3
Have a TMB92SS as well. It’s never failed to please. When I get time will organize a few folks and set them up side by side. Not so easy getting folks out in the North East this time of year. Brass monkeys are on the prowl looking for welders..,0
"Thanks Phil! Nice to finally have a weight. By comparison, with rings and dovetail,.  TV85, 6.9 lb.  AT92, 8.8 lb.  AP105, 10.7 lb. So, smack dab between my Traveler (in its original configuration), and my TV-85. In reality, with the added FT focuser, accessory bar, Starbeam, and Losmandy dovetail on my Traveler, the weight advantage between the two scopes definitely goes to the AT92.. Doea anyone recall the weight, with rings and dovetail, of the new Stowaway?.",1
"The website says ""Weight with dust cap"" is 7.1 lbs. It comes with tube rings and dovetail but I don't know if this weight includes the rings or not. My guess is this is just for the tube..",1

"Well, I'm the biggest fan of Michael and the team here going. I have to admit I am kind of wondering at this point, given that we were made to understand that the initial batch was shipped some time ago.. I am also an OEM, and I have learned over the years that frequent, transparent communication is always for the best in these cases.",0
"I spoke to someone at Astronomics a few days ago and was told that they are ""on the water""..",2
"I read on another forum that they were at customs. Were that is, is your guess is as good as mine.. ""AT 115 focuser question and back order status""post #19 in the refractor forum..",0
"They've been ""on the water"" for months. The trip on the Mayflower to America took only 66 days. Hopefully they are not ""under the water""..",1
My guess is that Michael Bieler is more frustrated than any of us. There is much about international shipping which he has little or no control over. It will happen and Astronomics will pull through for us as they usually do..,4
Customs in this case is in a port in Southern California..,2
That sounds promising! If that is the case. Keep our fingers crossed!.,0
It looks like a new batch is coming.. Tammy.,0
What happened to the old batch?.,0
Got an email today confirming my preorder information.  Looks like the time is close!. keith.,0
Same for me. I was told the estimated shipping time was within 14 days. Let's be prepared to cut Michael some slack. I'm looking forward to using this scope..,0
"I've had mine on preorder for a year and a half, but did not get an email. Guess I'll give 'em a call.. Alex.",0
"I got a phone call and e-mail this morning, wanting to confirm that I still wanted my AT115, because their shipment should arrive to Astronomic's next week.",0
"No email yet. Ordered mine last February? Probably going in order, should get an email soon..",0
"Looks promising. Maybe some of these will actually get into peoples hands soon. Should be a fun Spring and Summer considering all the scope shootout possibilities with the AT 92, TMB 92, Tele-Vue 85, Astro-Physics new Stowaway, Baader 95mm Travel Companion and some others I may have missed. The problem is getting these scopes together at one time, but eventually it will happen.",0
"Does anyone recall when the AT92 was first announced?. i have a saved email from July 19 (2017), and a copy of my order 3 days later. But it may be I missed earlier announcements.. Alex.",0
"Wow, your one of the first ones to place an order for the scope. I placed my order in February. I called and asked if I would be in the first batch. They told me yes. You shouldn't have anything to worry about..",0
Are there going to be more batches coming in after this one? It sounds like the first run is already spoken for and then some. I am wondering if they're already planning more runs to meet demand or was this a one time only thing?.,0
"Well, I bought mine onAug 28, 2017, and have not seen an email so I assume that an email is not essential to delivery from the first batch..",0
LOL I think the freighter Captain stopped for the Holiday's and had a lot of Rum and Eggnog. The Scopes will be here soon and when they are let the new years party begin. It is just a fact of life when it comes to telescopes that it takes time from the announcement to build interest (and Orders) to the time they are built tested and shipped. (The slow boat from China fits here) then they arrive are unloaded and scoped out by customs then loaded on a slow 18 wheeler from FedEx or UPS for a 4 day ride to Norman. Once there Michael and team inspect them test them and do all the needed work to ship to the customers. add up to another week for that and finally you have a scope. It is a rough life for Michael and his team but the wait and the product is well worth it..,2
"Several weeks ago I had this mental picture of a new Astro-Tech scope under the Christmas tree.. Oh, what a wonderful sight that would have been...the scope box laying under the tinsel & ornaments, saying: ""Open Me First!"". But alas, this was not meant to be...whaaa, whaaa.",0
Easter is not far off..,1
Take heart. It will still happen. Next Christmas!.,0
"Patient gentlemen, I got a phone call from our sponsors this morning!. They needed to update my credit card info. Said they are going to ship soon. The truck is on the way to them, and that they will ship soon. For those wondering, I placed my order in February of 2018..",2
"Nothing new to add, more of a confirmation of recent posts.... I called our sponsors today to update my payment information and order a finder for the scope (they recommended their ATF). When I asked if they thought the AT92 would ship in a couple weeks, the response was that they thought it would be sooner, more like next week. 😀",3
"Just confirming elmikos post. I got another e-mail today, a PayPal request for the AT115 that is in the same shipment, and they said the truck is en route to them..",2
and all it would have taken is a 30 second post here saying so to avoid all this speculation and fretting..,0
Anyone got a shipping notice yet for either an AT92 or an AT115EDT?.,0
Not yet. But read my post above #482. So any time now..,0
"When I spoke with them last week, they thought the scope might ship this week. Checked earlier today, but no charge yet on my card. Shouldn't be much longer though I hope.. Alex.",1
,0
"Astronomics website says ""in stock"".",2
Right on!! Thanks for the update Linda.,0
"LOL! That's a common technique with websites to get your order, and your money, regardless of whether an item is really in stock or not..",0
You're suggesting they are still lost in the burmuda triangle?.,0
"Not suggesting anything. I can only say from personal experience that many vendors will do this. They'll even list an item as ""in stock"" on the website order form. Then when it doesn't come for a couple weeks and you call to see what the delay is you find out they never had it and are waiting on the mfgr. I will say that the silence from Astronomics here is deafening..",0
"I ordered the AT92 a year and a half ago, and Astronomics has had my credit card info since day one. I have yet to be charged. At least in the case of Astronomics, I find your comment a bit unfair.. It appears that the scopes have arrived this week, just as Astronomics said they would. When we see our charge go through, we will know that the scope is being shipped to us. Sure, we are all excited about seeing this new scope, but do we really expect Astronomics to give us tracking info on the scope's trip TO the vendor?. i think we are getting close.. Alex.",3
You will get a confirmation email and tracking number update. At least thats what they did when I bought an AT60.,0
"That has always been my experience with Astronomics, including the order for my finder last week. They have never charged my card until shipment was ready.",0
"Astronomics doesn't need ""In Stock"" to drum up sales....The AT115 was essentially sold out during the past 10 months when the site said ""More on the Way/ Wait List""...The AT92 had an even longer wait time""In stock"" only showed up today, for both, and the only available ones are going to be coming from the people who canceled their pre-orders..",0
"Astronomics is very fair in this regard. They don’t hurt your pocket unless the product is ready. Ordering one ensures your place in line , but just like the guys above say , they won’t charge you till they have it in hand. It is exactly the opposite  ,most others will charge you and not have the product.Who really is the honest guy here in fact.?. Any time I bought something from the guys its always prompt good service. The AT 92 is a highly anticipated scope people who put a possible charge on their card have a place in line as the order was placed.. So let’s not bash and indeed give them credit.",0
(Cue Sonny and Cher music). And the beat goes on;. And the beat goes on....,0
"Remember, they still have to check and 100% the scopes before they ship them. Patience my friends, we will have them soon..",1
Glad you all never had that happen to you. My experience has been different..,0
Have you ever dealt with Astronomics?.,0
"Uh, yes but never again..",0
"My order was placed 8 months ago. I pay by PayPal, and it's always shown up as ""pending"", and I've had to renew the payment every 30 days, since that's as long as PayPal allows to claim the funds.I was finally charged last week, so I take that as fact they actually have the shipment in hand..",0
"I have bought a lot of gear from Astronomics over the years and have never seen astronomics conduct business this way. They have never charged my card for an item until it’s packed, shipping documents have been cut, and the item is just waiting for the UPS guy to come collect it and deliver it to me.. However, for AT branded scopes that have been “out of stock” for a long time and are in high demand, I have seen the item marked “in stock” on the website after the item leaves the port in CA, but before it actually reaches them in Oklahoma. When this happens, I think it might be their way of giving us a heads up that delivery is eminent, and it’s time to place our orders if we haven’t done so, or perhaps the IT guy is quicker on the trigger than the delivery driver, but nothing devious is going on. If you call and ask, I am sure they will give the most accurate and up to date information.. For really common items that everyone usually has in stock, like TV EPs for for example, it wasn’t uncommon for the old website/computer system to say something was in stock when it wasn’t, but it wasn’t intentional. It happened often enough to me that I would always call and ask if the item was actually in stock before ordering. If they said yes, I would ask them go into the stockroom and verify that the item was physically present and snag it for me rather than relying on their computer system. On occasion, the sales representative would find the item wasn’t in stock, but it was clearly an honest mistake..",2
I guess everyone's ship has come in. I already have two 90mm scopes. Should i try out this new AT92?.,1
"Chas,. After 507 posts in this thread, a decision should be relatively easy. And if the scope ends up not being what you want, I am sure it will find its way to someone else's hands pretty soon",2
"You know you want another one Chas, what's one more scope in the family..",0
"Well now I get it, you have an agenda..",1
Chas: do it. Why let the other two 90mm scopes get in the way..,1
You'll be kicking yourself if you don't and it sells out. If my new Stowaway hadn't just come in last month I'd be jumping all over it. If you don't like it or get bored with it after a minute or 2 you can always sell it and probably won't lose much if it's unavailable..,0
Hmmm. An agenda to not do something. That's an odd definition..,0
"I am content to wait and see what Astronomics delivers and hear what the first 100 buyers report. Based on the information that Michael has dribbled out in various posts, everything about the new scope is new and untested in the market place except the name and aperture. It’s been called a “collaboration” with TB, but TB has been in his grave for about 11 years now, so I doubt TB did a great deal of collaboration in the traditional meaning of the term. Perhaps it would be more accurate to call the new AT92 a derivative work.. The new designer is well respected and Astronomics has a very good track record for bringing high-value refractors to market. I have owned two inexpensive, Chinese-Manufacured AT refractors and have been very satisfied with both, so I am looking forward to reading user reports about the new AT92. If it’s a great product, and it makes money for Astronomics and its manufacturer, I am confident there will be another run.. I am concerned about the value part of the AT92 equation though. Seems to me, $1,800 is a lot of money to pay for a 92mm Chinese refractor when I can buy 100 mm Tak from Astronomics for about $600 more. By comparison, the AT72EDII that I own cost about 1/4 of what a 76mm Tak would have cost me. Still, I might buy an AT92 if it turns out to be a great product. Time will tell..",0
"Just some info. Random zygos from the scopes. As discussed95 strehl or better and 1/6th wave. Looks like one is a hair under 1/6th.. I would call the work as much of a collaboration as Free As A Bird by the Beatles. John recorded it at home in 1977 and Paul, George, and Ringo finished it up in 1995 15 years after Lennon died..",13
"Actually the silence from astronomics is simply that I don't check every thread on CN all the time. If anyone ever has a question, all they have to do is call and we will tell them as best as we can. At times, we are held up to a hiccup from the manufacturer, like we paid from them in November, but they didn't actually ship until a month later. They also arrived at the dock on Dec. 26th, which is when we started to charge cards so we could get them prepped and ready for shipment. Trying to hold the delay to shipping to as short as humanly possible. Nothing nefarious, just getting our ducks in a row.. The delay also held a pleasant surprise for the 115EDT. New for 2019, collimateable cell, new focuser body housing, and Aston Martin Grey trim..",16
"We went with the zygo report on each scope for two reasons.. 1. Was a guarantee to me that we were getting what we specified.. 2. It would save me time getting the scopes ready as the Zygo will always be better than my eye doing a star test.. Now, the zygos are not included with the scopes and stay here with me as I have been down the zygo report envy road with TMB. I do however think I will buy this one for myself.....",12
"Yea, yea, RHIP but dang, envious here.. 😉",0
"Perhaps you would, but song lyrics and software are IP that fall under copyright law, telescope hardware designs are IP that doesn’t, not the same thing. Similarly, “collaborative work” and “derivative work” are terms of art that are used to describe IP, they aren’t the same thing.. Based on what you have told us about the development history of the new AT92, “collaboration” does not seem to be an appropriate description. Just as “dead men tell no tales,” they do not posthumously collaborate on new telescope designs. However, their work often becomes the basis of a derivative work done by a subsequent designer, which seems to be the case here based on the information you have disclosed..",0
I will still call it a collaboration as it is the easiest to explain..,3
"I just sold 5 scopes Sunday. So i do have the room. I have a dead sharp W/O 90mm , so it would be fun to compare them both. FC kinda scares me once you get below F/6. I don't image at all. But for real i went on over load the last year and just got burned out and had to clean house and get some fresh air. I need to step back for a while. I have my 10"" Cave and two 90mm scopes to use. I am sure one day i will try one out..",1
Well the AT102ED was about the best bang for the buck going last year. I think this scope the AT92 is geared more for imaging..,0
That’s fine with me..,0
Shipment notification alert!!! YES!!!,6
"Yep, due Wednesday!  And the forecast is for CLEAR! Astronomics did say on the phone today that they were including 5 clear nights with the earliest orders..",5
My AT115 is due Wednesday !!!.,1
I’m jealous!.,0
"Those are some bumpy wavefronts but the numbers look good, especially the one Mike wants to keep!. Mike, any chance you can ask the manufacturer what the story is with the blank ""Aperture OD %""? They should be testing 100% of the outer diameter but some vendors previously did not, with SV doing 95% apparently because they had some problems with the testing procedure at 100%. If these numbers are for a test of the full aperture, then they are pretty impressive. If the test was done at a reduced aperture to limit edge aberrations from affecting the image, then it is much less impressive.. Anyway, if the question can be answered, that would be great..",0
My AT115EDT is coming Wednesday too! Woo...hoo!.,2
"Oooooh.. +1 on the ""jealous"" front.. So the 'scopes came in just as the ""win a AT92"" competition finished.. that worked out nicely! Will be watching closely for the winner to be announced.. c'mon lady luck!!.",1
AT92 shipping notice received today. I'm looking forward to this! Thanks again to Astronomics for making this one happen..,4
The lenses are tested at full OD. So the entire piece of glass from edge to edge is tested.,9
Yeah - thats a fair assessment. Almost 2G's. Im sure its a fine scope but 92mm is 92mm and its an import for sure. Nothing wrong with that at all(Ive owned plenty) but your point about that dollar amount getting you close to some other very tempting scopes is what makes this more debateable value-wise.. Still - Im sure those that ordered one will love it..,1
Got my shipping confirmation! Looks like this Thursday will be Christmas all over!!!.,2
"I think that one of the things that differentiates this particular scope from a typical ""import"" is the fact that the most important parts (like the objective) are made to a detailed specification, and that the updated specification is based on a hugely successful product that was done by a respected designer. This is no re-brand.. I'll be happy to share my experiences with everyone as soon as I get the chance to use mine.",1
"I would love to see a 90mm ed doublet, f8ish on the market. I know it may not be seen as marketable with the 102 ed, but I can dream, right?. I look forward to the AT92 reviews..",5
+1 on the shipping notification!.,2
"I have owned many scopes over the years, 2/3 of them were inexpensive scopes imported from China, including the scope that I own at the moment, an AT72EDII. All of them were good scopes, and they have improved over the years, so i have bought a lot of them. The best of these approached the expensive premium scopes that I owned at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it took side-by-side testing on nights of good seeing to tell the difference.. Would I pay Tak prices for an imported chinese scope? Sure, when I see convincing proof these scope are the equal of Tak or other premium scope.. The computing device that I am using to write this post is imported from china, and its among the best devices I have ever owned, and it’s definitely the most expensive. I am not sure we are there yet with imported chinese optics though. When I replaced my handheld bino recently, I considered one of the new APMs imported from china, but went with another Fujinon at twice the price..",1
"So jealous of you all. I wonder who submitted the most reviews to up their chances? Certainly wasn't me, but wish it had been...'cause the 92 is going to go down as one of those classic scopes, I have a feeling..",3
That is great to hear. Wish it was on the report but still. Looking forward to reading some impressions once it gets into more hands!.,0
All good - I also have had good luck with imported refractors but my point was that usually the money I saved was a nice plus and part of my purchase decision. I personally would pay TAK prices only for a TAK! Why not at that point? But if you can get TAK-like performance for tangible amount less money then count me in too Regardless -this AT92 is an exciting scope and gives me hope that we might see more 88mm to 92mm optins in the near future..,1
"One of the strengths of the chinese scope manufacturers is that they listen to their US distributers and quickly add the features we want, such as sliding dew shields and 2-speed focusers, features that might be high-cost extras on a Tak or not available at all.. For example, a two-speed focuser is a very expensive option on the 100mm Tak, and a sliding dew shield is not available at any price. This is the reason I don’t own this Tak, and I am considering the AT92 among other candidates..",3
"Yes, please! The field curvature is what has me concerned with this one. At f/8, this 92mm would be perfect for me. That being said, if I can scrape up the money, I am so buying one of these (even though it's super fast). A longer focal ratio would make a great scope even more awesome, but it's pretty darned amazing as it is.. Hey Astronomics, pretty please consider coming out with one medium to long focal ratio version for us silly purists? Eyepieces work so much better and higher magnifications are easier to achieve..",2
"I totally agree! That and the 115mm f/7 are going to be highly sought after scopes (heck, they are already). The 92mm is on my must-save-up-to-buy list and I'll buy just as soon as I have the bucks. They're pretty much all that's left of the TMB legacy..",0
"Has anyone seen actual movement on their tracking? Mine only shows that the label was printed. Not fretting, but since I have to adjust my schedule to be home to sign, just trying to get a better idea if the scope will actually show tomorrow. If some of you are seeing progress, I will assume things are on schedule. I realize tracking info is not always complete..",1
"Yes, I have. Due on Friday. I'm busy tying a hundred yellow ribbons 'round the ol' oak tree Okay, that's admittedly an old reference, but what the hey... why not.",1
"Old reference, but I'm old enough to recognize it.. I did just get a FedEx update that the package was only picked up today, thus delivery is delayed until Thursday.  However, this is exactly what happened when my finder came from Astronomics last week. Once picked up in the late afternoon, it was on my doorstep in ATL at 10:25am the next day, arriving within the original 2-day window. So still hopeful it might show tomorrow!. Alex.",2
"Well, as it turns out my Fedex shipment got updated from Friday to Thursday. Aaaandthat would be a first with me for Fedex, regardless of what product or where it's coming from. Ever.. You know, it's almost as if Fedex knew I was free on Friday and needed to ""adjust"". Paranoid? I think not",2
"The update may be automated based on where it shipped from to destination. I just very recently had a FedEx shipment where the standard transit stated 1/12. Then I received an email with a ""schedule delivery"" of 1/11. The package was still several hundred miles away on 1/11 so I read up on it and apparently the standard transit date can be more reliable.. Hopefully that's not the case but just a head's up..",1
I guess they are all sold out by now. I am thinking crazy stuff..,0
"Outer boxes came in late yesterday, so they didn’t actually get on a truck until today. However, they are all out there and on their way. Chas, there is still inventory on hand..",3
"To sell the TMB or not to sell the TMB for the AT92?. Decisions, decisions.",0
"If you decide to sell your TMB, please, please, please let me know. :-).",0
"I am curious to hear the early impressions. After selling my old SV 70mm doublet (which I regret), I am in the market for something small and portable.. Judging by the weather we are having in Southern California, I can only assume that at least one of these is headed here..",2
"Since it sounds like these might already be sold out or will be soon, does anyone happen to know when (or if) another batch might become available? These are very special telescopes and I think they will become highly sought after legends in the future. I would love to buy one, hope I can.. Those of you who are getting your AT92 soon, would you pretty please post lots of pictures and user reports?.",1
"Mike posted earlier this evening that ""there is still inventory on hand"". If you really do want one, there probably is no better time than the present. Isn't that why credit cards were invented?. If current circumstances don't permit, be patient. Like all scopes, used ones will eventually turn up for sale. Alex.",1
Someone buy them up before i do something crazy..,0
"Chas,. I am kind of lost in terms of what is in the current scope stable. However, if you have nothing decent in that range of 80mm to 100mm, this would be a lovely scope to own.. Had I not managed to secure one of the AP92s, I would have jumped on this one....",1
"Oh, just go do it - you know you want to, and you're already crazy",2
I have a super sharp W/O 90mm F6.9 and a ST90 that is very good. So kinda dumb for me to get another 90mm scope. I just loving trying out new scopes..,0
"Well, two choices. Take one for the team and give it a try vs the WO, or sit tight",0
"I am seriously considering buying this scope for imaging.. There is some English on Astronomics' website about the scope providing a flat field. I hope this is true because I see nothing about a flattener for this scope on their website and the only APO's with an integrated flattener I know of are quads and sometimes 6-element units.. Has anyone imaged through this scope yet? And is so, what was the result, especially as it pertains to come-free stars near the edge of the frame.. Thanks in advance..",0
"I am sure that there will soon be some feedback and samples of AP images, but right now the AT-92's are all still in transit. I expect mine on Friday, but no doubt there will be a month of clouds to overcome..",0
"I had the same WO 90mm ED scope - a real beauty and with excellent views as Chas has seen. But I was in that APO quandary wanting something in this aperture range. So I reluctantly sold the WO and bought a used SVR90T from CN.. after waiting for the AT92 for what seemed forever and then deciding to get something used for less benjamins and to wait and see on this new scope.. I love the SVR90T - fantastic views, smooth operation and elegant form factor - but I am keeping a close eye on the AT92 and the first-light reports. Congrats to those getting this beautiful scope - I hope its killer!. Clear skies!.",0
"I was told the AT92 has field curvature, but one can use one of the AT flatteners..",0
"Who's your source?. I spoke with someone in sales at Astronomics today and he did not go so far as saying any of the AT flatteners would work. Not that they couldn't, but that he/ they have little experience or feedback on this scope, especially as it pertains to imaging..",0
A scope that fast MUST have field curvature unless a flattener is used. Basic optics..,1
"There is a user on AstroBin, pfile, who uses a TMB92 + TRF-2008 reducer with what seem to be pretty good results. Check out his stuff. It seems he also uses an Orion flattener, but I'm not sure if he specifies which one..",2
"True, unless one of the elements also acts as a flattener. This is the case with some quads (Stellarvue SV100Q) and some hexes.. Have never seen a triplet do this, but then again the Astronomics website claims it produces a flat field..",0
"It was another post here on CN, I'll try to find it and post a link..",0
"Thanks, that's helpful info. I'm sure this can be done and that some solutions exist, I just need this verified before I spent almost 1800 bills..",0
The flat field was in respect to smaller chips when the copy was first written over 10 years ago as full frame DSLR didn't exist for the masses. Any question about field flattness should be directed to information with the TMB92. The scope does not have a field flattener in and any reference has been removed. For large chip cameras you will indeed need a flattener of some sort. This Sky and Tel article should give you direction to the optics of the scope..,1
All fast refarctors have FC. No way around it. Same for fast Newts having Coma. I am sure i will try out a AT92 one day soon..,0
"Thanks, that's helpful.. So it would seem that this scope coupled with my ZWO ASI183MM-C camera, with its 13.2 x 8.8mm chip should experience only modest coma at frame edges. Is that a fair assessment?.",0
I think you are on the right path. Over the years the stander AT2FF has worked well with the TMB92. Tom passed before he could get a flattener finished for the scope..,1
Rats! The Fedex man came today but I was not home to sign for the OTA! I actually watched him walk to my door with the OTA box in his hands using my Nest Doorbell Camera. But there was nothing I could do and I watched him walk away back to his truck and drive away with my new scope...So close yet so far...lol! Oh welll...Delivery attempt 2 will be tomorrow..,0
Hopefully you will have better luck tomorrow..,0
That sounds painful!.,0
"Mine came this morning, really, REALLY early !If our dog hadn't jumped out of bed and woken us up, I'd have slept right passed it....",3
Congrats!. That dog of yours must have been excited about the AT92 also.. sounds like a keeper!,1
"I have to say, I find all of the naysaying around the pricing of the AT92 a little perplexing, and the common justification for those comments being that it is ""Chinese-built"" downright confusing (especially when then talking about nice WO scopes).. Admittedly I have exactly zero experience owning a refractor, but I do have interest in owning one and would lean towards the 90-100mm range if so. Looking at some of my options in this range for triplets:. As much as I might like to, I won't consider the Baader Travel Companion (roughly double the price) or AP Stowaway (never mind the price, I may well be dead and buried before one was shipped to me).. So I'd say Astronomics have done their market price research and set a completely reasonable price which (clearly) people are willing to pay..",3
"I think the AT92 is going to be amazing. I just wish there was a visual version with a longer focal ratio. Even with the fast focal ratio, I definitely want to get one. Thank you Astronomics for keeping Thomas Back's work alive and available!.",3
Let the pics of the scope start coming..,2
"ARRIVED!. Triple boxed! Quadruple if you include the case. Good thing too, given the puncture holes in the first two!. Photos to come.. Alex.",6
"Here it is.... The cat's reaction is, ""Ho Hum, yet another telescope."".",13
"So which is it, FCD100 or FPL53?....",5
"Nice Aleko, wow! FPL53? That's a nice surprise. Mine is out for delivery today!!!. Could you please show the focuser??. Thanks Mike.",0
"I thought the original description claimedFCD100, but I could be wrong. Now it is listed as ED in their website. No matter what glass is used, performance will be key.. It looks nice, congratulations..",1
"I found the focuser somewhat crude. That is, until I realized it was a cap over the knob! Nice touch!.",5
"It had always been advertised as FCD100, so it was a bit of a surprise to see it labeled FPL53. My guess is that the label is wrong, but I will ask Astronomics.. Alex.",1
"I have an e-mail to the manufacturer about the trim ring. The optics are FCD100. The original prescription called for 53, but was changed to FCD100 when the scope was reintroduced..",1
It did. I'm quite confused about the FPL-53 now. Maybe... they couldn't hit the 0.95 Strehl requirement consistently with the FCD-100 objectives? Very interesting.. Edit: Posted just after Mike. Good to know. Should have been caught before they made like 100 of these things. Maybe these will be a special vintage because of the error..,2
I will find out about getting new trim rings made with the proper engraving. It will be a few days..,1
They hit is just fine. It is a typo on the manufacturers end..,0
"With any luck they will just machine the proper ring and everyone will have the right piece and a ""collector's item"". Not that it would be much of a collection...... I can only assume as we started the project with FPL53 almost two years ago that they had the original CAD drawing for the trim ring in the system. When we changed the prescription to FCD100 I would hazard a guess they just forgot to change those 5 letters. In the end however, I am pleased with the zygos that are coming out of the scope. The numbers seem to be very consistent with a few super outliers..",5
"Beautiful scope! Looks like a mini version of the AT 102ED only with sliding dew shield (the AT102 should have had one), better glass and probably better focuser. The font passes inspection too Looking forward to some first impressions/ first light reports..",1
"So what's the latest, Michael B., are you including the Zygos report with each purchased AT92?. I recall reading, about 112 pages ago that you aren't.. Thanks.",0
We are not. I have been down the road with TMB with Zygo Envy and have no interest in going down it again. The original Zygo is kept here and tied to the original invoice number of the original purchaser..,1
"Very exciting, the scope looks fantastic.. For the 2.5"" focusser, is there a male or female thread for attaching a flattener for those that wish to experiment - perhaps M63?. I appreciate there is not a dedicated flattener, at least yet.. Thanks, Chris.",0
"As he posted earlier, they will not provide the reports but will keep them on file for reference.  And avoid any customer angst created by variations of a couple % in STREHL.",0
"I'm a bit confused by you answer, Michael. Are you saying the scope's Strehl score WILL be included as part of the buyer's invoice/ receipt, but not the Zygos report itself?.",0
"The proof will be in the views, which for me won't happen until Sunday (first light, eclipse?). But a few quick initial impressions. Keep in mind that my purpose is for air travel.... As hoped, this IS a one-handed scope. Tube not quite as narrow as the TV-85, but I can still easily get my hand around the tube to carry around with one hand. And the weight with rings and dovetail come in at 9lb-4oz, a full three pounds lighter than my similarly configured Traveler. The length, with the 1.25-inch adapter as a focuser plug, is an even 17-inches, shorter than the TV-85 or Traveler by a couple inches. So, the scope definitely passes the ""handy"" test. The only concern here is that the combo of length, girth, and weight might cause one to get too careless in handling!. The provided case should protect the scope well, and is carry-on compliant, but I will probably go with a smaller, soft padded case for actual carry-on air travel. The one provided is a but bulky for my taste. There is also the option of the Pelican 1510 if going for ultra protection. Since the scope is heavier than the TV-85, I'll have to go on a few walks with the scope to see how I like toting it. But again, I save 3 lbs over the AP105.. The scope looks nice. I was dubious about the Astin-Martin Grey, but Mike made the right choice, and I'm glad he chose that color. The dew shield works nicely, and extends out a bit even when fully retracted, so for those in dryer climates, one may not need to extend it. Extended, it is more than sufficient. I don't care for the rings much (so far) as it seems I have to open them all the way to move the OTA. But I will play with it some more, and I could be wrong. I like the rotating focuser, very easy. I also like the way the diagonal lock twists to loosen, rather than using set screws. Over time I will be comparing the scope to the Traveler and TV-85 and attempt to finally choose my air travel setup. The key for the 92 will be whether it punches enough above its weight to where I won't notice much light loss compared to the AP. I am also on the Stowaway list, but I'm hoping I'll be happy with the views from the AT92. Looking forward to hearing other reports!. Alex.",6
We keep the zygo reports here. We tie them to the original purchasers invoice that is kept here in house. That way we can track down any information if needed. They Zygo will never leave this office..,0
"Hoo boy, that's chunky. I wonder if it's even possible to make a 90mm triplet under 8-9lbs with rings and dovetail, since most ever made seem to be around that weight (TMB92, SV90, TS90, Stowaway). The Borg 90FL and Tak Sky90, though doublets, are almost feathers in comparison..",0
"With a little customization I trimmed my TMB 92L down to 7lbs, 1oz. with rings and mounting plate. I replaced the focuser with a 2"" Feathertouch focuser and tube adapter and replaced the original clunky rings with a pair of Stowaway (original version) rings. Attached to the rings is an AP 7"" sliding bar/ mounting plate. The scope is now both an optical and mechanical treat..",3
"Though the AT92 weight is about midway between a TV-85 and a Traveler, in handling it some this morning it felt a lot closer to the TV-85, probably due to its short length and being able to still one-hand it. But no, I would not include this in my kit when portaging the boundary waters. For that I'd probably stick with my 2.1x42 binocs!. Alex.",2
That's a nice savings. So the 92L stock focuser and rings were really that heavy? Pretty wild..,0
"Haha, duly noted. I already think the TV-85 is too heavy for that, having more experience up there now. 20lbs of telescope gear (including tripod and mount) is still a lot up there when you consider the logistics of portaging it with everything else. It could mean the difference between double carrying and triple carrying a portage, and screw triple carrying. I think I will stick to binos, but if I get a super light kit, I might be able to stash away a small backpack with a 60-80mm scope and 1-2 eyepieces and bring a single tripod to share between cameras for everyone in the group + telescope mount for those clear nights that would make it worth bringing in the first place. 31T5 + 8E maybe? You know I gotta have that wide field....",1
The gear load considered essential on the first trip is often considered way over the top by the second..,0
"Haha, very true... my groups for both canoe trips last year were pretty minimal though; I managed to bring a pair of 3lb binos on both trips and a small camera tripod as well for the second trip. But... there's no room for a Pelican case and another tripod, really. It could possibly be done if you really load people down for portages but I don't want to have to do that. However, if I am going to go in and stay at one campsite for the entire trip, I will consider the additional hassle for sure just like we will consider the hassle of more fresh and heavy food!.",0
"Tout est arrivéz! Unboxing follows.... Very well packed - double boxed, with peanuts and foam pads isolating from the box itself.. A view of the well-protected hard case..",4
"Hello, my darling..",13
"Trying to keep the view objective, so to speak..",8
"Finally, a temporary resting place while more permanent accommodations are arranged. Not sure a Cube will handle the heft. I will say, it balanced just fine right where it is mounted there..",8
"Another big plus for those into reasonably priced AP, I am pretty certain that a Rigel stepper for WO scopes will fit right on this focuser. I have one and will confirm at some point in the future. Obviously Leon could also confirm.. Ah, my garage has New Telescope Smell!",1
Looks good. Ok now someone pump up the power and see how a star image looks at 400x if the seeing is good..,2
"Nice scope! Nice pocket knife, I have the same one..",1
"Let's see, I think I've got a 1.25MM eyepiece lying around somewhere. 😀.",1
"Mattyk USA , you beat me to the unboxing! I will still post mine. Hey did you happen to see where the serial number is located?? Seems like a great scope. Cloudy here of course. Hoping to get it out tomorrow night if the weather man is right..",1
"Pop corn, anyone?.",1
"The serial number, I think, is written in marker on the plastic bag that was wrapped around the scope! If so, mine is #44. Alex.",2
"Let's see, a receipt, another box..",2
"Ooh, nice case! I'll be styling at the next Star Party..",2
Opinel #8 is timeless. I use it just about every day. I heard (but you know how those things go) that Picasso carved all of his prototypes with the same model..,0
Looking good!!.,7
"Never even looked. Now I will, though.",1
"Feels substantial, but not too heavy..",3
And the business end..,7
"Well, unless someone from Hollywood comes strolling down the street in my neighborhood, there will be a bit of an intermission while the inevitable cloud cover dissipates..",0
"BTW, if anyone happens to know how to attach the AT reticle finder to this scope, please let me know. I do have an email in to Astronomics, but I'm sure it got their after business hours.. Thanks!. Alex.",1
"Sitting next to my 10 year old Astrotech 66ed "" auto guiding duties "". Atop Atlas' shoulders..",13
"With camera attached, waiting for clear skies!..",6
Tube looks like it has a bigger OD than my W/O 90mm..,0
"We are going to do something about the serial number as well. Laminated card, or something else once I talk to them about the trim ring on the lens..",3
"Beautiful!!. Something caught my eye - it says FPL53! Nice... I know this was stated an eternity ago - and maybe somewhere in between new info was given from Astronomics that I might have missed - but way back in post #4, Mike stated the following:. Posted 19 July 2017 - 10:03 PMIt is a triplet with a center element of FCD100 (ED), one mating element of LAL14 (Lanthanum), and then a third element.. Was just the center element changed? Is the LAL14 mating element still being used?.",0
"Mike, isn't there a physical serial number on the scope itself?.",0
"It depends on what attachments you have for the finder.. The ""foot"" that comes standard with the finder can be attached with one screw. The **** would use would be one of the four at the roughly 11 and 1 o'clock position.. If you have a vixen style stalk you can attach the ATSHOE to one set of screws and slide it right in..",2
"There is not. I was expecting it on the trim ring, but it wasn't there. This is something I will take up with them. We may just pay out of pocket to get new trim rings made for the scopes..",3
"Why not offer to sell a small metal plate/plaque with the model name and serial number on it? These can be made inexpensively at shops doing awards, they have machines to do theinscribing and they just use the same materials as they use for the plates going on awards. I suppose one could even have a line for the owner's name. It could be attached with four small screws to the case. I would pay an additional price to have this.. The other option is to do what other manufacturers have done and have a sticker you place on the tube or the focuser. I think the plate would be classier, but I guess everyone has different preferences. I just worry about plastic bags and certificates getting lost, I have seen this happen before with so many other scopes. Example, my TMB no longer has its original certificate and manual. Fortunately, Markus Ludes was able to send me a copy of the testing certificate and other CN members helped me out with the manual (thank you!). BTW, the AT92 looks totally awesome, I want one in the worst possible way! Sigh, time to sell things so I can buy one!.",0
"Mike, are you planning more runs after this one? I hope so, this is a real winner and I think demand will only grow..",0
"We will do another run after this one, as it seems to be going well. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk",3
"No, it's not FPL53. A little surfing back a page or two will enlighten you, without us ""in the moment"" folks repeating already resolved stuff  - no offense intended..",1
"That's so awesome, thank you, thank you, thank you! Count me in, this is a must have scope. :-).",0
We all have high expectations for the AT92. No reason to expect otherwise. But: we have no observing reports yet! Here's hoping for the best!.,0
"Received a beautiful AT92 yesterday, by time I got home it was overcast. Tonight we had a slight break so was able to get in some very nice views of the moon, and even an image. Got to say, excited in waiting for the eclipse Sunday, this is going to be a perfect size with an APS camera for lunar and solar eclipses! Will be a couple of weeks before I can get to a dark sky to shoot with an 8300 chip.. I got the 92 because I can shoot mono with the TEC 140 with the AP FR, and have the 92 shooting with a QHY290 covering the same field in color at the same time. Or at least that is my long term plan.. Will do a full review when the sky is a bit better than tonight, and I have more time to look at the mechanics. But first impressions are really good.. This is going to be fun!!. keith.",12
"I can't believe it is cloudy here in Arizona. Supposed to be clear until the monsoons in August. Any ways, it's supposed to be nice tomorrow night! I like the texture of the white paint on the 92 trip. I think that it will not dew up as much as tthe smooth anodized aluminum tubes. Atleast that is my experience.. Fingers crossed. I will post performance of the scope as soon as possible. It will be an imaging report though. That's really what I got the scope for in the first place.. Clear skies Mike.",0
"Thanks Mike. Just to make sure I get this right, you are saying I can attach the standard curved-bottom foot to one of the four round hex screws in the grey area, correct? (Picture below). I don't want to mess anything up!.",1
Correct. Those are designed for finder attachments. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk,3
Nice moon picture Keith. I don't see any chromatic abberation!!!! Looking good!.,0
Piece of cake! (Once you know how! ). Thanks Mike!. Alex.,5
I would never use a finder with this scope as the FOV is so wide. Never even used a finder with my AT102ED. That moon shot looked good..,0
Yup.  The best refractor finder is a 55mm Plossl..,0
Well if I didn't have my TMB92L all packed up ready for Sunday's lunar eclipse I would run down to Norman today for one of these little gems. Sure is fun to watch everyone opening their late Christmas presents. Perfect timing too with the eclipse Sunday night.,3
"With my 31 Nagler, I will get a full 5 degree TFOV in my AT92. Awesome! That's a larger field than the one in my finder on my first scope! So yes, the AT92 can act as it's own finder.. When I use a red dot finder on a scope like this, it is for high power viewing. When spending a session doing double stars, using the pointer allows me to leave my high power eyepiece in the scope and still hit my target. There is then no need to change eyepieces back and forth, thus avoiding frequent rebalancing of the scope. Different jobs, different tools.. Alex.",5
"Too bad only the central 2.5deg will be in focus... lol. OK that's maybe a slight exaggeration but not much more.. I do actually enjoy a RDF on my small scopes so I don't have to swap eyepieces just to find something. It's pretty cool having a high magnification eyepiece in and you use the RDF to find something, look in the eyepiece and BOOM there it is! I'm with Alex on this one - you either rebalance or you have to hold the diagonal carefully so the scope doesn't take a nosedive, and even then, if you're using the 31T5, everything else is going to be lighter, so you may have to rebalance on a short scope like this even if you have the mount balanced for a ~1.2lb eyepiece and moderate tension applied. Such is life with the Terminagler..",1
"I recently picked up a TV Equalizer to help balance 1.25"" EPs with my new 31 T5, so hopefully that will help. Obviously that doesn't address the moments in between removing the 31mm and inserting the new EP, but it should make it easier to find a point that isn't too far from balanced with each EP. Pretty clever little device. Simple and (hopefully) effective.. For starhopping with my 4"" refractor, I find a green laser pointer and a RACI 6x30mm finder to be the perfect combo. It really minimizes the need to swap EPs when hunting for something..",0
"Funny, I own one and have used it in the past, but haven't seen it in a while and honestly forgot I had it. I will go find it because I could use it for my 5mm DeLite especially when swapping between it and a 2X Powermate'd Ethos! Yes, an Equalizer is a good thing to have when you use a lot of heavy eyepiece combos!.",0
"If there is enough backfocus, for us imagers a flip mirror would be ideal - No need for a finder, just mount a guide scope to the top of the rings.. Speaking of which, Michael B, what is the backfocus length of this scope? Flip mirrors can get lengthy..",0
It's on the product page..,1
Congratulations!!. Just got my AP Stowaway today!. Jim,3
Optical tweaking and verification. Switching center element glass made it necessary. Basically Tom had great ideas and made great instruments. Roger is a master and trained over decades at his craft. It is a watchful eye that is needed to take a great idea and try to perfect it..,3
Thanks. Burton.,0
"Indeed. Thx. Just measured my Orion imaging flip mirror and got a length of 80mm. That, coupled with my T2 quick change system (with its 15-17mm backfocus) and 17.5mm backfocus of my ZWO cameras, just gets me in there with not much wiggle room..",1
"Just a couple more impressions.... There was was a brief semiclearing of skies after sunset. There were too many passing clouds to judge anything optically. But I used eyepieces from 10mm down to 3.5mm, looking at the moon, and everything looked good considering.. What I can say is during the brief session, I was very happy with the ergonomics of the scope. Not too heavy, but heavy enough to give a bit of that TV85 solid feel. The scope easily balanced with my midrange Ethos eyepieces and a few XWs. I love its shortness and compactness. It matches very well with my Porta II mount with Hal130 tripod, giving new life to that mount. The focuser is smooth with no issues. Ergonomically, the scope just works. Comfortable as an old pair of slippers.. I also had a few minutes to line up the Astronomics ATF red dot finder. Solid, well made, compact, easy to use, choice of reticles. I've got a couple of quibbles with it, but it seems to be an excellent match to the AT92, for those who may be thinking of adding a finder.. Won't be able to judge optics until Sunday night since the clouds came back quickly. Guess I can do some deep sky stuff with it during the eclipse.. Alex.",5
Will have to keep track of the reports on this scope. I think my W/O 90mm weighs a good bit more than the AT92. I may get one yet this year sometime..,2
Weather has snuffed first light opportunities but here it is. Well done Astronomics..,20
"Another rainy night in Georgia, and apparently raining and snowing all over the world, so instead of an observing report, you get a size comparison of three travel scopes: Traveler, AT92, and TV-85. The dewshield on the AT92 makes the scope look a bit wider than it really is. The main OTA is definitely narrower than the Traveler. I can one-hand the AT92, not so with the AP....",13
"Hmm. I have two out of three of those OTAs. No TV-85. I must be living life wrong, or something",9
If i keep seeing all these pics i will be tempted..,0
Is that car a Porsche 911 targa? Earlier vintage? Just curious.,0
Keep the pictures coming guys!.,0
"'82 911 Super Carrera Targa, yes. 53,000 ""gentle"" miles  still all original. It's gotten a little too valuable to drive all the time, so it's a bit of a garage queen these days.. One off-topic pic.",6
"That little scope is downright fat compared to my Stowaway! Ok, that may not go over too well withany ladies owning this scope. It's very Rubenesque!.",0
At least you guys get to play with yours. Mine was supposed to be delivered yesterday but the snowstorm cancelled that. New delivery date won’t be at least until Tuesday. All I can do for now is live vicariously through your pictures so keep them coming.. Sam.,0
"Weather has been bad everywhere. I had two good seeing nites about 2 weeks ago where i could go to 500x on Mars and did great on a 10"" F/6 cave. Cold temps and fronts make for bad seeing in my area..",0
"Bummer, Sam. FedEx does delivery Monday though, so maybe you'll luck out.. Alex.",0
"On top of everything else, even if the clouds would part the wind is enough to almost knock over a tripod.",0
I think all the AT92's made it cloudy everywhere i guess. No viewing reports?.,0
"Not an AT92, but my TMB92L made it out just fine, to be run by my bundled up granddaughter..",7
"I've wondered about the deafening silence myself. IT IS COLD even in Georgia, not pleasant for casual observing, much less evaluating equipment. So hopefully that is the reason for the silence.. I will only say for now that I had the AT92 out for the lunar eclipse, and after half an hour of not being wowed by my view, switched over to my NP101 for the duration of the eclipse, thoroughly enjoying the rest of the event. Many variables that night, so not fair for me to say more until I've had a clear, steady, moonless night. I still have hopes for the scope.",1
"How so? More CA, astigmatism and/ or coma, etc. on the AT92?. Did you use the same eyepiece when comparing the two scopes?.",0
Don’t read anything sinister into my not updating beyond weather and work preventing me from observing. Wow. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,2
"I did not take the time to narrow down the problems. It was cold as heck, and there was an eclipse going on. It was best just to pull out another scope for the time being. But same eyepieces, same weather, both scopes cooled. No back and forth compare done. Just set the AT92 aside and enjoyed the eclipse through the NP101.. I expect to see better results, or else figure out what's going on, when there are proper conditions for an eval. Probably Friday at the earliest. Not fair to judge this or any other scope otherwise. No one should conclude anything based on my experience so far..",2
"Maybe some pinching due to the cold? It was 3F for the eclipse here, can't imagine Georgia was quite that cold, but it doesn't have to be that cold for metal to shrink..",0
"Ok, I will help break the silence. I have only had my 92 out three times. The first time was last Friday night. I imaged M37 and M109. I had to deal with a almost full moon. Plus the seeing was not very good. There were high clouds and with the light polluted suburbs of Phoenix it causes a lot of gradient in my photo. You can see my photos in the CCD imaging and processing forum. The next night I imaged the Leo triplet. That is also posted there. I imaged the lunar eclipse on Sunday. Shot through high clouds. Out of fifty pictures only four or five look somewhat clear. As far as visually I have not had an eyepiece in the scope. So I can't make any judgement on that.. I did notice a slight field curvature on the images from the first night. That was remedied by using my field flattener, which I already had.. In conclusion, I haven't had good enough seeing here to make a solid judgement of the scope. Although. I do really like the asthetics of the scope. The focuser holds my camera without a sweat. It is smooth. The dew shield stays put when the scope is pointed upward. Some scopes in the past have had an issue with the dew shield sliding down from gravity. I didn't notice any purple fringing on the moon from the eclipse photos.. So waiting for better seeing for a more in depth review.. Clear skies Mike.",6
"Let's give it time for more reports to flow in before jumping to conclusions. However, lets not start making unfounded excuses either. If an NP 101 wasn't pinched then the AT 92 shouldn't be either. Let's hope this isn't another case of optics that are compromised by an inferior lens cell!.",4
"Same people that do the cells for the 130, 115, and 80 so I don't think that is an issue..",1
"Elmiko,. I can't for the life of me find your posted images. Can you provide a link or search string.. Thanks.",0
"I'm just amazed that bad weather and busy lives somehow turn into ""let us hope they're not all disintegrating before our eyes!!!"" within a matter of days. It's almost like someone has an agenda.",5
"I don't see any evidence of an agenda here. Just one report of disappointing visual views, that were clearly bested by a different scope under the same conditions. We all want to see this scope succeed. I myself have waited a year and a half for the thing. It's gorgeous to look at and fun to hold. I look forward to testing this under ideal conditions. I have even started testing with an artificial star indoors. I will not report what I see until I can do another outdoor session, and have another experienced observer confirm all the results.. No need for everyone (yet) to speculate. No need to disparage other people's comments either. But I guess this is CN. I hope to hear some good reports coming in soon..",2
I found a few:. https://www.cloudyni...t/#entry9091181. https://www.cloudyni...7/#entry9088083. https://www.cloudyni...ic/647480-m109/.,3
Send it my way and i can sneak in a nite with it. Tonite is clear and not cold. I have a very good ST90 that would be fun to do a side by side. I am sure the AT92 would kill it on color and should have tighter and smaller stars. Also have a 90mm W/O that is super sharp but at F/6.9 they are diff scopes..,0
"That report was good, objective, and not what I'm talking about. Foreboding comments from the same folks, repeatedly over time, are what I'm talking about. I am only trying to keep it real, and calling out when I see what look to me like unfounded implications is, I think, fair play. Just as I understand you calling out what I stated.",2
"We're just a little too far apart, mein freund. Otherwise, either (a) I'd be in the good weather or (b) I'd drop by with it and take you up on your offer. Certainly would enjoy the comparisons and hope to do a couple myself at some point in the future.. You know, once I retire (2020-2021), we're headed your way, but east coast. We might be able to actually get together and see what's what with some of these scopes (as long as you promise not to sell them for new stuff while I'm not looking, you've kind of got a known thing going there)..",2
"Sometimes cautionary comments are needed to somewhat counteract the apparent ""fanboi"" attitude some have in regards to anything associated with AT. The ""agenda"" seems to flow that way mostly. Calling for more eye witness reports doesn't seem to be uncalled for IMHO.",0
I looked up the optical numbers on the scope and there shouldn’t be any issues with it. So no clue why the views might disappoint.,1
"Totally agree, didn't mean to point fingers or anything. I was just suggesting one possible reason why views might not have been satisfactory. My AT72EDII did exhibit some problems with pinching at cold temps, but that was at 10F and below, with stars almost completely triangular at -10F. I didn't particularly enjoy being out in that temperature but dang was transparency good!!.",0
"This says it all, for me. Enjoy your role.",0
"It is okay to ask about more first lights, but as most were received late last week and the first of this week there hasn’t been a ton of time or good weather to give any real sort of review. I think it is fair to give people ample time to use a product and post a true review and not push for information that doesn’t exist. I am not sure about fanboys, but I do believe we have satisfied customers over 40 years as Astronomics and over a decade bringing in Astro-Tech. While we can’t make everyone happy, we sure do try. And I think our efforts is what make people happy about our products over the years, giving them pride in the product. I like to think we bring some of the best value to astronomers in the market today..",11
"Blunt statement but I tend to agree about ""balancing"" the comments out foralltypes of fanboys foralltypes of brands. A healthy dose of skepticism never hurt anybody. As for Aleko's comment about deafening silence from buyers, I think the reason he phrased it that way was because he was already a little disappointed with his experience, and thought maybe others were too, and suggested it to see if others might chime in and say ""yeah I dunno, seemed fairly sharp but I expected more"" or something. Anyway, I firmly believe weather is the cause, as it usually is, when people don't chime in with their thoughts about new gear..",1
Spoken like a true vendor with a vested interest in the product under discussion. I agree that there have been many (even mostly) positive comments about the various AT offerings on the market. Let's let this offering speak for itself..,0
"I don't do double talk. I care about my company that I have been part of for 40 years. I care about our products. And most importantly I care about my family. All of these are part of Astronomics, Cloudy Nights, and Astro-Tech. I will take the good comments with the bad any day. I just don't like people pushing for things that just aren't there yet. Let them breathe and grow naturally before you start hunting for issues. You have stated you have a problem with us, and that is fine. I can't please everyone no matter the circumstance..",16
"I am done with all the crazy buying and selling. But a AT92 is still on my list to try out. I just paid some bills for $6k and now have to plan on a new roof in about 3 years or less. So i am gonna take it down a step or two. I have 3 scopes for now, but would love to see what the AT92 can do with super high powers on my best nites. The AT 102ED did 400x fine on the moon and i figure the AT92 can do the same..",1
"I will refrain from more comments after this until I have observing feedback to share. That said, a point or two.. Skepticism and doomsaying are two different things. It's been how many days? Broad statements about the nature of honest and objective feedback notwithstanding, it's far too early (IMO) to see posts implying defects in an emergent product.. Okay, that point is enough. See you on the other side of actual observing....",3
"Michael,. i believe mine happens to be one of the four or five whose numbers you posted to the group last week, so that is why I am a bit puzzled. I've done some indoor star testing tonight, and wil try a couple things differently tomorrow at the suggestion of a knowledgeable friend. I might get a chance to view real stars again Thursday or Friday, and do some real conditions testing then.. Talking to to my friend, and knowing the numbers are good, I'm hopeful everything will turn out to be fine. If there still appears to be a problem, I will contact you first before posting here..",2
Keep in mind it's not just bad weather that has kept some of us from trying out the new scopes and giving reports. Some of us have more pressing things to worry about. The day my AT92 arrived was the same day I had to put my dog to sleep. Since then I've only opened the case once to look at it. Haven't had much of a desire to do anything else yet. Be patient. People will start posting about it soon enough. No news isn't always bad news..,3
"Ok, I thought I would share a quick picture I took early this morning. Quick shot between targets, Using the AstroTech 92mm triplet and Atik 420 osc. This is the double star CorCaroli in Canes Venatici. Mag.+5.52 and +2.89 sep 19.3 "". 25 1sec subs quick stack and stretch Heavy crop in Pixinsite.. I think I got a good sample. I am pleased..",14
"So, while waiting for the next clear night, this arrived from Germany in three days....Oklop padded bag for 80/600 refractors (product number: 55875).It is a padded carry bag that is an excellent companion to the AT92. Plenty of room to spare, even with the diagonal attached. Though this soft bag is 24-inches long, the ends have plenty of room to scrunch in with this scope, to meet airline carry-on restrictions. Really, this could quite possibly pass for the personal item rather than the big bag. I find it less bulky than the supplied case (which is still a good case, just too big for my taste). I most likely will use it for all situations with this scope, not just flying. It's light, compact, and handy, just like the scope itself.. I found out about this on CN, but don't remember the thread (possibly this one!). A big thank you to whoever posted about this bag. It's a winner with the AT92..",9
Thanks! All feedback is good..,2

A BIG me too. I'm very sorry to hear about your dog. Been there too many times and it never gets easier..,1
Very nicely done too,1

So...has the lucky winner been announced?. Ken.,0
Still waiting to hear back from them.,0

No the winner is them. We have reached out and haven’t heard back from them.,0
We aren’t announcing anything until we have heard back and get everything squared away with the winner.,1
Having fun with the new scope. It's been collecting photons all night long. It's a balmy 37 degrees here in Phoenix..😎.,10
Nice!. Which camera and flattener are you using? How effective is that flattener for eliminating coma?.,0
I use the Astrotech FF2 for F/6 to f/8 refractor. It works with the 92 f/ 5.5 you have to make sure the spacing is correct between the Flattener lens and the sensor on your camera...57 mm.. Checked out your videos. Nice job!. My Dad and two older brothers were from Westbury.Long Island!.,1
Thanks!. I used to live in Westbury... Small world!.,1
"Here's my AT92. All tech-ed out and ready for the first clear night.. Going to image bareback the first night - No light pollution filter, no flattener, no protection..",13
"Bigbanger, My ccd is a osc Atik 420. It has a small sensor 8mm. So coma isn't to bad a problem. I noticed a slight coma that's why I added the FF..",1
"Good to know... Thanks. So that FF made the edge stars coma-free?. I'll be imaging with an ZWO ASI183MM and MC. They have relatively small chips (15.86mm, measured diagonally). Based on your finding I now expect some coma, but with 5496 x 3672 pixels I'll be able to do substantial cropping while still retaining a large image; maybe 3000 x 2000..",1
"Gosh Mike, I must not have gotten your email. Try me again !!!.",1
"As luck has it, the person got back to me today. We will be talking about the particulars tomorrow and work on a post after that. Thanks everyone for participating and we will consider doing something else in the near future..",5
"Expect it will take a few months to get enough scopes in the hands of enough thoughtful and experienced users in good weather to get a real sense of how this scope performs. Then, we must keep in mind that it’s a very fast 92 mm scope that’s optimized for applications such as airline travel..",0
"With the glass selection (O'Hara SFPL53 & SLAL14 + a third component-Post #6, above) the designers have chosen a very high quality APO potential foundation. The element powers should be quite low with attractive curvatures and smaller coma contributions. They could further their project more by leaning toward the F/6 end of focal ratios as even crystal crown elements run into a bit of color at lower ratios.. The place to especially target coma is in the reducer that should contain the same high standards as the main optic. It is there that long-exposure digital capture design results can really shine..",0
"Of course. It takes me a few months with optics to truly get a feel for them. This is partly because I don't get the opportunity to go to one of our decent dark sites very often. I was only able to visit our good site (Bortle ~3.5/SQM ~21.3) once last year, didn't get to the really good site (Bortle 2) at all in the last 2 years. Most of my observations of are planets, the moon, and terrestrial objects. I know there are many who don't have the luxuries of dark skies who still want widefield scopes, just like me, who are probably in similar predicaments. I try to live vicariously through people who have better skies and more time (like driving 90mins each way on a weeknight)..",0
That's an excellent promo. Great band! Sorry to all for the swerve.......,1
"I am following this thread because I am considering the AT92 as a possible grab-and-go scope for use at home. The AT72EDII fills that role for me now, so I am content to wait for better data to accumulate and concensus to develop as the installed base creeps up and the weather improves enough to allow thorough testing.. The weather has been poor across most of the country since the AT92 started to ship, so I am not surprised there aren’t more reports being posted. The report situation is not much better for the AP92 that started to ship before the AT92..",1
I’m sorry about your dog. Puts a damper on things for sometime.. All the best.. Phil.,0
"Time for an update.. Last week I pulled the AT92 and replaced it after half an hour with an NP101 for the lunar eclipse. The reason was unevenness of focus. Not field curvature. For example, a crater on one side of the moon might look sharp, but on the other side not. Could never get things looking right. Both scopes were cooled on that miserable night. The AT92 for something like 8 hours. The seeing was not good that night, but the NP101 seemed to handle the same weather conditions the AT92 couldn't, thus my disappointment that evening.. Tuesday and Wednesday evenings I did my best to do an indoor star test with an artificial star. 45-ft distance, green filter, 2.5 and 5mm Naglers. I am not an expert at this, but I saw no evidence of collimation problems. Inside and outside of focus views differed, but I've looked through killer scopes that did the same. In focus, the star test looked very nice. Tonight, almost the same weather conditions existed as last Sunday. I took the trip to our group's nearby darkish site (Bortle 4-1/2) for a very short session to see what the AT92 might do on deep sky. The seeing was fair at best, but transparency was quite good.. As it got dark, I took a quick tour of some double stars with a 5mm Pentax XW (~100x, ~1mm exit pupil). Castor, Rigel, eta Cas, Gamma And, and Polaris, though not challenging, all looked nice, with perfectly round stars. I felt the color was a little weak, but I find that sometimes happens when seeing is not the best. Then, I went to the Pleiades and the Alpha Per cluster for wide star fields with the 31 Nagler. The nebulosity in the Pleiades was evident, the stars sharp. As to be expected with such a short focal length, there was a bit of field curvature. If I wasn't looking for it, I probably wouldn't have noticed it. It certainly wasn't as bad as I feared it would be. I did also try the 35Pan, and think it might be a slightly better match for this scope. Need to compare some more. YMMV.. Then, a quick check on some nebulosity. The Andromeda Galaxy was very impressive, with both companions also easily evident. I had to remind myself that I was looking through a 92, not a 105. There was enough aperture to bring out the galaxy, but also enough field of view to frame it nicely. On to the Orion Nebula with a 21E. Game, set, and match! At this low power (24x, ~4 exit pupil), what I call the entire Orion Loop (imagine Orion Nebula's arms stretched and curved over the head so that the fingers are touching) was easily evident. In addition, much of the middle area was visible, showing texture and detail. The streakiness was definitely there. At low power in a 92mm scope. No filter. I then changed to a 6E for some more power. Simply magnificent. I had also planned to try Barnard's Loop with an H-beta filter, but forgot the filter. But who needs a filter? Barnard's Loop was readily visible in the AT92 with the 35Pan, without the filter. So, still not sure what went wrong eclipse night. But tonight, the AT92 started to show me what it could do. I am impressed with the contrast. Will do more viewing with it tomorrow, this time with several additional experienced observers joining in the fun. I didn't make a final judgment on eclipse night, nor am I making one tonight. But I am a lot more encouraged after tonight than I was last Sunday. And I once again found it a joy to handle this scope; so easy!. Looking forward to hearing from others as they get a chance to try out their new scopes..",17
Nice! Sounds like it is starting to perform as expected! Bernard's loop would be ideal in a wide field scope like that.  Great match with your ethos too.. Looking forward to hearing more reports!,0
I get the same kind of view on the moon with SCT's at lower power were the field edge is bent or i should say out of focus. I am so tempted to just order this scope and slap the power to it and see how it compares to the AT102ED. Just the seeing has been so bad here with all the fronts and colder weather we have had..,0
"To quote a company's logo: Just do it!. Look, you like testing scopes. Try it, you may like it enough to keep it. If it doesn't suit your style, I am sure someone from the community would be glad to take it off your hands..",2
True. I also got a new SUB woofer on my list. The scope would be lighter for sure..,0
I am wondering if it is due to AT92 thin collet?. It takes a little effort to secure camera/diagonal with AT92 collet. I've been testing AT92 and TMB 92SS side-by-side.. I am using Vixen HR 2.4 eyepiece.. They both show almost identical view of lunar surface. I didn't see any uneven focus.. I felt like looking through the same scope. They both have excellent color correction.. Here is moonshot with AT92 a few days ago.. http://www.pbase.com...728523/original. Tammy.,12
"Tammy,. Can you add the shot to your post, I cannot access the link you provided..",0

"Nice moon pic Tammy. How do you like the new scope? I love mine. Still haven't had an eyepiece in it yet. I bought it to image with.. Clear skies, have fun. Mike.",0
"Nope still cannot see it. That's why I'm asking if you can include the photo in your post, not a URL but the actual photo..",0
That's very strange. So you can't see pbase.com image at all?. It looks like Cloudy Nights image size restriction is larger than the original image size 337957 bytes.. Here you go:. Tammy.,7
"I can see the images on pbase just fine Tammy, the whole grid of images, plus the AT92 one. Maybe rkaufmann is using a JS blocker or something..",0
"I'm at work and we have pretty tight security restrictions here, so I'll check when I get home this evening..",0
"Do as I say, not as I do! Checking the collet, as Tammy suggested, the scope slipped out of my hands. Made a quick recovery thankfully. I was SOOO close to dropping the scope on the floor.. Be be careful out there!!!. Alex.",0
"Nope. I went there and saw the Pbase sized default image without Javascript. Tamiji's first link to the ""original"" size works without Javascript, too..",0
"Yes, I think this may be where the problem exists..",0
"Yup, me too..",0
"Here is AT92 with TMB 92SS.. TMB 92SS focuser is replaced with FT3215 with ES 3"" diagonal.. That's why TMB 92SS is shorter than AT92.. I like AT92 fit&finish better than TMB 92SS.. Tammy.",17
"We had an opportunity to test Alex's (Aleko) telescope under decent seeing tonight and I can say with certainty that it is a very, very good scope. Contrast was excellent and star images looked really good. Minimal if any field curvature in 70 to 82 degree eyepiece to my eye. The highlight of the night was catching the Pup (Sirius B). I had never seen it before but we were able to see it in the AT92. That made my night!. I'm sure Alex will add his impressions soon but as someone who has no skin in the game (I don't own one), I think his scope is a winner! Fun, fun night..",13
What Steve said.. I'll add a few final comments tomorrow.. -Alex.,0
"I first-lighted my AT92 Friday night. Being for the most part an imager, I took several test images. As you examine the images keep in mind that I live in a white zone (30 miles from Manhattan), I did not use a light pollution filter as I wanted to limit the optical glass to just the scope’s, and I did not use a field flattener for the same reason. In addition, sky conditions were not great. While transparency was good (4/5), seeing was poor (2/5). The air temperature went from 33F to 28F in the course of the evening. Not extremely cold, but cold enough to reveal the first sign of pinched optics that can result from lens cell contraction.. All pictures were taken with a one-shot-color ZWO ASI183MC-Cool, which produced an image scale of 0.98”/ pixel.. The first test looked into resolution. The background image is a 2-minute exposure of M42, reduced to 30% of its original size. The breakout at top left is a 1 second image of its embedded Trapezium star association (it’s at top right) at 100% resolution. Lots of space separates the four stars.. *****************************************************************************************************************************. Tests 2-4 will appear in subsequent posts because CN limits each post to no more than 500KB of attachments. The final test posting will include my conclusions and thoughts. *****************************************************************************************************************************.",7
"The second test looked into the amount of coma present in the absence of a field flattener. This 2x3min stack of the Pleiades shows a fair amount of coma on the edge stars. (The attached image is once again 30% of its original size) This is not surprising, though with a smallish chip (15.86mm measured diagonally) I was hoping for bit less, especially as, to the best of my knowledge, Astronomics has not yet built or identified a compatible flattener for this scope. Also, coma present at the top left edge of the picture seems to be a bit more significant..",6
"The third test looked at an artifact I’ve seen on several recent APO’s I’ve owned. It’s a kind of kaleidoscope or repeating reflection effect of a very bright imaged star. I’m not sure what causes it (internal reflection?) or whether all refractors have it to some degree, but I do look for how extensive it is and whether it’s symmetrical in appearance. Here we have a 5x2min stack of Betelgeuse also displayed at 30% of its original size. You can clearly see this artifact.. *********** UPDATE **************. Thanks to Astrojedi I now know this to bemicro lens diffraction from the sensor. It has nothing to do with the scope's optics. *********** UPDATE **************.",7
"And finally, we have the moon. Attached is its image reduced to 50% of its original size. It’s quite sharp considering the poor seeing.. While I am by no means an expert on grading optical systems, here are my preliminary conclusions and thoughts.. 1) Stars are round even in fairly cold temperatures, indicating the absence of pinched optics - A problem I’ve had with several APO’s from well regarded manufacturers.. 2) Despite imaging on a night of poor seeing, images were as crisp as I could have hoped for.. 3) The slightly more pronounced coma displayed at the top edge of the second test image, as well as a trace of the “rainbow” effect on dimmer stars (where one edge has a red tint and the opposite edge has a blue tint) suggests that one or more lenses are not totally perpendicular to incoming light. Perhaps there’s a bit of collimation work needed, but it’s so minor I will probably not bother dealing with it.. Overall I am happy with this scope and would recommend it to other amateurs looking for a sharp, fast, wide-field, well made APO at this price point..",8
One more from Friday night.. A 1 hour 32 minute exposure (92x2min stack) of M81 using a ZWO ASI183MC-Cool camera. The image has been reduced to 75% of its original resolution then cropped..,13
You guys keeps this up and i am gonna hit the order button..,2
Never saw anything like that visual. It that something that just shows from imaging?.,0
"It's in another thread, but I had never weighed my TMB 92L with rings and Vixen bar. I am at 5 lbs 13 oz total weight. That's with a homemade plastic replacement for the dew shield, a Feathertouch focuser, Orion 90mm rings, and a 4"" solid Vixen bar. I could save a little more with a hollow Vixen bar.. Over time we may see mods to the AT92, but it seems sacrilegious to mod such a new beautiful scope. Maybe the next run could be an ""AT92L""?. George.",1
"It's probably present but too dim to see visually.. If you're a visual only person, you may not know that those of us who image DSO's stretch the image's histogram do bring out dim details. In doing so we reveal this artifact. At least that's what I think is going on..",0
"Great report BigBanger, very well done. I will look for the kaleidoscope artifacts have not noticed any yet.. Clear skies Mike.",1
Most likely micro lens diffraction from the sensor..,3
Thank you!. I looked upmicro lens diffraction and it is indeed what my images are revealing..,3
AT92 -> Baader T2 Prism Star Diagonal -> Quick Changer -> 1.25x GPC -> Baader MarkV -> Televue Delite 18.2. came to focus to infinity. I have about 5mm infocus left.. Tammy.,3
"Very nice, informative series of posts, BigBanger. Thank you..",1
"Was able to install a robofocus motor, install the AT-2FF (flat field), attach an SBIG STF8300, and get setup for V-Curve testing through the clouds tonight and was able to build up a solid bank of v-curves for focus. Focus brought an HDF of 2.13. Very tight and clean.. As you can see from the 5 x 1' M42 image stack, the central area has very good star images, with degradation increasing to edges of chip. Seems I need to work on the spacing, but it is within the 4mm range of the 57mm required for back focus point of the AT2FF. Not concerned yet, this is a great start between clouds for the first try.. If anything this will be great with a slightly smaller chip, I am looking to use this as the color source for images.. Waiting on some small (5mm) T thread items to see if changing the spacing further improves edges.. Keith.",4
"So having read the thread for the past few days, I will guess that the Astro-Tech (AT2FF) shows the most promise as the ""goto"" Field Flattener for the new AT92. I plan on using the ZWO asi1600mm-pro with this scope, more then enough image circle for the chip, would be nice to see the actual FC in relation to chip sizes.. Keith (KShank) looks like your doing the heavy lifting for us here, thanks for your info. Would appreciate the follow on when you get the spacing issue dialed in.. Not to leave BigBanger out of the mix, great info as well Sir. clear skies. Tim aka (Digipainter).",1
"So elmiko how did the imaging session go? can we see your results, the AT92 looked nice atop the Atlas-Pro.",1
"So, to follow up, this was the second night in a row of very satisfactory visual observing. The star images in the AT92 were sharp. I noticed over the two nights that it was very easy for me to get an exact focus; no racking in and out looking for that right point. I don't think anyone noticed any color. The stars had a nice clean brilliance to them. I've been able to take the scope to magnifications that exceed my tolerance for floaters. Contrast was excellent, scatter low. It's been at least a few years since I've managed to pull out the Pup. That it was done with the AT92 was a treat. Though the views were bested by Steve's LOMO 102, we both agreed that the AT92 brightness and contrast hung in there very close. If they hadn't been side to side, it would not have been anything noticeable.. I've already mentioned the form factor of this scope, but I can't get over how fun it is. It's compactness makes it a treat to grab (and hold) and go. The padded Oklop bag I bought for it, mentioned earlier, makes it even easier. The optional Astronomics ATF finder has worked very nicely with it, though I do find the reticle too bright. I have yet to definitively figure out the first night problem during the eclipse. Clouds moved in as the moon came up this morning, so that will have to wait. I think Tammy may have hit on something though regarding the collet. It's easy to tighten without the diagonal being quite square. The only other issue, which would be the case with any scope of this focal length, is field curvature. For me, it wasn't a problem unless I went looking for it. YMMV. As Steve mentioned, things looked fine with 70 and 82 AFOV Pentax and TV eyepieces. I used my Ethos as well, and it was only under low power that things got a bit messy near the edge. Certainly nothing that makes it look like you were taking off at warp speed.. i still need to compare this scope to my Traveler. But I can say that I would not hesitate to fly to the southern hemisphere with the AT92 to enjoy the celestial wonders there. It is small enough to be easy to travel with, and still has enough aperture and contrast to provide satisfying views, whether it's the wide fields of the LMC and eta Carina, medium fields like Omega Centauri, or higher power views of 47 Tuc or Alpha Centauri.. I think the the AT92, along with the Astro-Physics Stowaway, will make folks think that maybe 92mm is the Goldilocks size for grab and go.. Alex.",10
"This image of M81 taken with my AT92 got so many likes that I figured I should make it available in full resolution and without the compression I had to use to display it on CN with its 500KB attachment limit..

"Great to hear that the AT92 is behaving better for you, Alex! It is also inspiring to hear that even with the 21Ethos (I assume anyway) that the FC isn't too obvious. Though the focal length is the same as the Borg 90FL I had, it is possible the AT92 design has some correction for FC, or at least more than the Borg.. Truth be told, I still haven't seen a good explanation (diagram, photo, screenshot) for how a triplet design can correct for FC. I would love to know how exactly this is achieved when designing a set of lens elements that work together, and what other compromises have to be made in order to correct for FC. Most people just talk about correcting CA, SA, spherochromatism, coma, and astigmatism. If anyone can help explain what must be done to correct for FC in a triplet objective (or doublet even), please do. I think it would be very useful knowledge especially when talking about a scope as short as the AT92, with a focal ratio leading to a shallow depth of field which makes he FC even more apparent..",1
"J-. I consider the 21 Ethos to be a low power eyepiece, especially in the AT92. Of the 35Pan, 31N, 21E, 17E, and 13E, it was the 21E that got a bit ugly, though only on the outer 5-10%. The 17 and 13 were fine, and the 35 and 31 were pretty decent too. I haven't been using my 35P much at all, but it seems to take rather nicely to this particular scope. It gives only 1/3 degree less TFOV (4.7d!) than the 31N in the AT92, and has a nice bright exit pupil, great for those large nebulae that are helped by filters.. Alex.",2
"I ""liked"" your last image, but that was a like that covered all of them..",0

"aken from red zone backyard Jan 19 2019. AT 92mm trip f/5.5 w/ AT ff I am really liking this new scope! Ok, loving it!. Atik 420 osc w/ Orion sky glow filter. 36 500sec subs dithered ( 3 hours).

Critiques are welcome..",13
"elmiko I would say you did great, esp on the whirlpool, The Horsehead was very nice I was especially interested in how Alnitak and other larger brighter stars rendered, where in your imaging train did you place any filters? The last pic (Leo Triplet) was very nice. I know I will enjoy this scope when it arrives and I get it set up. Thank you for sharing your images.. Clear Skies. Digi.",1
"I don't know of any fast fractor than can lick FC, they all have it , just like all fast Newts have Coma. Above F/6 i can deal with FC, at F/5 with my ST90 it drives me crazy while sweeping and some eyepieces make FC even worse. A older Tele Vue 15mm Wide field in my 90mm F/5 makes me sea sick as stars are so out of focus while sweeping i can't live with it as stars come and go out of the FOV. It is like a bowl shape image of the stars.. Wish they could make a Paracorr for FC like they do coma..",0
Just all perfect shots..,1
"I read thatThomas Back and Roger Ceragioli created the design for this scope. Must be an older design, but it looks like a fantastic scope. The performance from the pictures I have seen looks outstanding. With the triplet lens the field must be pretty flat. I did not notice anyone stating they were using a field flatner..",0
Petzal refractors = flat fields (if done right). But I know you were referring to doublet and triplet refractors..,0
"Thanks Digi and ChasLx200, I like the scope for imaging. I use an Astro Tech field flattener with it and also an Orion sky glow imaging filter screwed onto the scope side to combat my red zone light pollution.. Love the compact size and weight of the 92 f/5.5. I was using my Orion 8 inch imaging Newt. F/ 3.9. that scope puts out some nice images, especially for the 450.00 price. It was about the max amount of weight that I wanted to put on my mount though. The AT 92 is 1/3 the weight. It is easier to get longer subs.. I am having a lot of fun with the new scope. Hoping for steady clear skies tonight, nearing new moon!. Clear skies your way also Mike.",0
"Digipainter, I didn't answer your question about the bright stars like Alnitak in the Horse head. I am still learning Pixinsite for processing. That strange two shades of blue around Alnitak was caused by my post process attempt to try and mask the star and reduce its brightness. Does look strange, I know.. Still have a lot to learn. Post processing is definitely the most important thing to make a nice looking image.. Mike.",1
"Actually Mike I liked the effect, similar to what I would get using a telephoto camera lens with an aperture mask instead of the built in irisand better then the reflected circles (filter/sensor reflections) I get with what I am using currently. I am still in the learning process myself when it comes to processing. I will be getting the AT92 at the end of the week so I can start playing with it and the AT2FF and the asi1600mm from everything I have read and seen it looks like it will be a dynamite scope. This will be my 1st triplet APO, so I am pretty excited. Thank you again for sharing the photos. I will post some after I get the scope.. regards. Tim. Clear skies everyone (my clouds have already arrived LOL)",1
"Ya, Tim, clouds are gonna be around here through the week too. Seems like clouds during the new moon, and clear as a bell during full moon lately. Great too hear you're gonna get the 92.! You're gonna love it. My first triplet also.. I use an Atik 420 ccd. It has a smaller field of view compared to the 1600 Zwo. My sensor is 9 mm diagonally.. Let me know how the field flattener works with your camera, just courious.. Looking forward to seeing your images!. Mike.",1

ZWO spacers (16.5mm + 11mm + T2~T2 (2mm)+ EFW 20mm + 6.5mm to camera sensor) for a total of 56mm. if you add the 1mm for the filter you get 57mm.. I got home this evening after dinner and was excited as the clouds where gone, so I set up the mount & scope with the camera and the asiair took a bit to mount the scope and all the equipment, get an alignment and get focused I was about to start an imaging run when the clouds magically appeared you guessed it, the New scope gods said NOPE no sneaking in a first light sigh, such a tease so I tore down the rig and put everything back in the garage but, I'm ready! perhaps next week if it clears. until then I wait.. Clear skies to those who have them, well wishes to those freezin yer butts off. Tim.",1
"Thanks Tim, for the details. The way I understand the instructions for the field flattener is that the 57 mm is from the camera sensor to the front lens of the flattener. The reason I ask is my distance right now is 58 mm from the shoulder to the sensor. Then I reread the instructions and it gives you two different measurements. I am a little confused. My stars seem to be round though. When you say the shoulder are you talking about the where the field flattener meets the 2"" tube that goes into the focuser? Mike.",0
"The blue line on the left is location of sensor , right is the shoulder.",0
This one shows the location of the lens of the flattener.,0
I'm not sure which distance to go by. What do you think?.,0
Here's a better picture.,0
Distance between sensor and lens of flattener.,0
"Tim, could you please post a close up of your camera and field flattener?.",0
"I struggled with this for a while but now it's simple math.. All flattener manufacturers publish the ideal distance from camera-facing side of their flattener to the imaging chip (typically in the order of 55-58mm). Add up the thickness of all components that separate the two, i.e. extension tubes, AOG's, filter wheels, filter drawers (all of them have published thickness values), and importantly and sometimes overlooked, the distance between the camera's attachment point and location of its sensor chip. The latter is published by the camera's manufacturer, but also be careful here. Some camera's have a detachable nosepiece that has to be accounted for (are you using it or not).. Here's my real world example. For the last couple of years I imaged with a Stellarvue SV70T coupled with a Stellarvue flattener/ reducer and a ZWO ASI071MC-Cool camera. The required distance is 55mm +/- 1-2mm. I set up my assembly, from camera to flattener as follows:. Camera - 17.5mm (distance from camera attachment point to its chip). Baader T-2 Quick Changer - 15mm. Astronomiks 2"" CLS filter - 7.5mm. 5mm extension tube. 10 mm extension tube. That totaled 55mm..",2
"Thanks BigBanger, I understand that. But in the end , with all of the attachments and or no accessories between the Flattener and camera sensor, the distance between the two should be 56 to 58 mm. Is this correct?.",0
That is correct..,0
"Ok, here's my configuration, you can see the plug for the desiccant tablet where the sensor is, the lens of the flattener is just past the grooves or knurled area. That distance is 30mm. Do I need an additional 27mm?.",1
If it's 30mm from the flattener's camera-side attachment point to the camera's chip then ABSOLUTELY you need 27mm worth of extension tubes..,2
"Thanks buddy, I went ahead and ordered a 30mm extension from Agena Astro. I think that will keep me within the tolerance.. Clear skies Mike.",1
"That should get you close enough to show an improvement. Many imagers would try to hit the mark a bit closer by grouping shorter extension tubes. Most come in standard sizes (there are a couple of variable length ones out there), i.e. 20, 10, 5, 1mm. I would group them as follows: 20+5+1+1..",2
"Mike here are the measurements I use, this is from the info/data sheet that comes with the astro tech flattener. the 57mm distance is from the rear shoulder (camera side) of the flattener. here is the photo of the info sheet.. and here is the camera, filter wheel, spacers and flattener.",2
"Thanks , Tim, that helps a lot. Thanks again BigBanger.. Clear skies Mike.",2
"Mike The spec sheet for you Atik should give you the distance in mm from the sensor to the rim of the body of the camera, you add this to the accessories like a filter wheel (mine is 20mm thick), after which I add spacers to make up the remaining distance to the back of the Field Flattener. This happens to be 57mm target spacing I am trying to reach, the mfg gives me a +/- 4mm variance to play with.. Clear as mud eh! Anyway Bigbanger said it better then me, I hope my illustrations helped.. Tim. LOL, we'll see how well I did when the skies clear and I can do some imaging I use this same setup with my AT60ed and AT72ed / Field flattener combinations and my stars are round out to the edge of the image. Clear skies everyone. Digipainter.",2
Don’t forget to account for the optical path length of the filters.,1
"I continue to be impressed by this scope. The other night I was imaging at temperatures of 16-18F and still the stars came out round. No sign if pinched optics due to contacting objective cell. That and the very sturdy focuser has made this one of the top 3 APO's I've ever owned. It gives up nothing in terms of optics to the $3,000 Stellarvue SV100Q and the $2,800 Vixen AX103S and its focuser is considerably better than that of the Vixen..",5
"I Have mine all dressed and ready for a go, now I wait for clear skies, looks like another few weeks of clouds and rain predicted as a huge storm comes in from the pacific, we need the rain I am sure it will not fail to be an impressive scope..",1
"Still cloudy here in Phoenix, ya those clouds are moving EastThe rain that is hitting in California is getting here a day later. The Weather man said we may have some clearing this Wednesday and Thursday! Keep my fingers crossed.. I want to image the Cone Nebula. It's placed pretty good in my backyard. Should be able to get at least 4 hours a night on it. Hope to get 8 to 10 hours on this target. It fits in my field of view nicely. I also ordered a 30 mm and 15 mm extension tubes to get the correct spacing. Thanks for the help Tim and BigBanger.. Mike.",2
"Get real guys, I live in the Northeast (not to mention 30 miles from Manhattan). Between the moon and clouds I'm lucky to get 3-4 decent broadband imaging nights per month....",1
"Hang in there BigBanger, summer is right around the corner. You'll probably be imaging in July and August. That's our monsoon season. I think the best months here are October and November. Then February through end of May. That's when the weather is perfect for imaging.. Can't wait to see everyone's results.. Mike.",2
"I had an unexpected opportunity last night to grab some imaging time. Here is the first light images from the 3 hours of time I had last night I will try again tonight if the skies are clear. The spacing is correct on the camera ~ AT2FF stars are round out to the corners of the 1600mm's sensor. as for the AT92 I am so impressed and a happy imager these are quick minimal edits for posting The Rosette, M81 ~ M82, Thor's Helm (only 2 frames recorded because it was dropping to low to image)..",10
Mike those pics I posted are using the spacing between the camera and AT2FF that I posted. BigBanger keep warm and surely you'll get some clear skies your way soon.. clear skies eveyone. Tim.,2
"Wow! Tim great job! You really demonstrate what the scope can do. Really nice data you captured.. I ordered an extra 15 mm extension, should come today or tomorrow. I appreciate your help with the spacing. I couldn't get my head around it. I guess I was not sure where to measure from. With my 30 mm + 15 mm spacers = 45 mm + 13 mm from camera sensor to the front edge of camera = 58 mm.. When I looked back at the Horse Head Nebula I posted I did notice that the stars were flared on the outer edges of the image. Looks like I will be good to go. thanks again for the help.. Again, great job on the data. Clear skies Mike.",1
Nice captures! I'm especially digging the details on M81..,2
"Tim, how many subs and exposure time? That Rosette looks great..",1
"Mike it was 28 x 180sec light frames, 10 dark, bias frames. I was having issues again with my guiding/mount (my AVX is old and needs a rebuild) but when it works it works.. Good luck, expect to see some nice data from your way.. Thanks BigBanger, I need some deep exposures and some RGB data to go along with that set of Lum I was very intrigued with the Lum stack and it was full of detail. Clear skies fellas. Tim.",1
Awesome job. Thanks Tim. Can't wait to see the final..,1
"I am getting some last minute subs on the Needle Galaxy NGC 4565, I woke up and slewed over to West side of the meridian to get another hour. I first capture Cone Nebula last night. Want to get a couple more nights before I finish.. Doing 5 minute subs on both..",1
"So much imaging and so little visual in here. Gee, you'd think this was a fast little scope primarily marketed at imagers!.",2
I was thinking that too.....,0
"OK already you two! but I do agree I'd like to see what others are doing as well. Here are two more from last night I've been waiting for clear weather as I haven't found that can of ""Cloud Shoo-Away"" and the vendor didn't include it in the case with the new scope tonight through next Monday is forecast for rain.",5
Looks good Tim. Supposed to be clear the next couple days. Fingers crossed. Round two tonight on the Cone Nebula and Needle Galaxy Ngc4565. My 15mm spacer came in the mail today. See how the stars look. My stars looked better with the 30mm spacer. This additional 15mm will put me at 58mm..,0
"here is my latest. Taken from backyard over two nights, Feb 6-7 2019. AT92trip f/5.5 ATff. Atik 420 osc Orion sky glow filter. 91 300sec subs Dithered. 50 bias 30 flats 30 darks. Captured with Nebulosity 4. Processed with Pixinsite. I think my spacing is correct, 58mm. pretty happy with the new scope.",13
And the Cone Nebula. 64 300sec subs. With the new 92!.,6
"Beautiful image.. If you don't mind me asking, can you account for the dark spikes arising from the brightest stars?. Thanks.",0
Looking good mike. I especially like NGC 4565. clear skies. Tim.,0
"Thanks Tim and bigbanger, as far as the spikes from the stars, I think my lack of experience in post processing is pronouncing any kind of seeing issues from my sub aquisition. Ie... Bad seeing, high clouds. Focus may have changed during the evening. I went to sleep for the last 2 to 3 hours of aquisition. I don't have a auto focus..",0
"That reminds me of the ""iron cross"" issue that people have talked about with WO scopes.. https://www.cloudyni...sue-fix-thread/. https://www.cloudyni...cept-or-return/.",1
"Indeed... It has something to do with the objective cell. Often issues with the objective cell have to do with it pinching the objective(s), but since elmiko's stars are round I don't think this is the case with his AT92..",0
"A guy I know just fixed some odd flares/shapes with his Megrez 90 (with round stars) by masking it down 1mm. Apparently there were collimation screws in the optical path? And when he had this problem on his Z61, he had to loosen some collimation screws (per William's instruction) which fixed the spikes in that case. I'm a little concerned to see them appear with the AT92, but it could be any number of things, so I'm not jumping to any conclusions, just trying to provide any info I have that might help..",1
"I think it may have to do with camera I use it has a small sensor the pixel size is 4.4 My pixel scale is 1.8 arcsec/ pix.. I think I am under sampling. Trying to remember the formula? I just checked out Atik site, the formula is. Pixel size ÷ to of scope × 206 So in my case... 4.4 ÷ 506 × 206= 1.79 I don't think that is undersampling ?. Once it gets clear , have to do some more testing..",0
I did check out the link jay I attached. I may have pinched optics! Apparently if you loosen the collimation screws a bit... That's opening a can of worms..,0
"Mike.  I would strongly suggest you NOT touch the optics of your new scope I would suspect many other things before doing that.. 1. is it repeatable during all temperatures?. 2. as you add filters and other things to your optic train you should suspect artifacts from those areas first. if one day you don't see things and you add something the next day and see something then suspect what you've added first, remove it and then check and see if it still exists.. 3. are you processing to agressively. I guess what I am saying is before you adjust things like the collimation on your scope you should eliminate any other source first. The I would check with the Vendor about checking the scope and adjusting it if you do not have the experiance or tools. regards. Tim.",3
"I'm with Tim on this. Remove all ""add-ons"", flattener, filters, etc. and re-image. If the ""cross"" is gone, odds are great that the scope is not the issue. Once that's established re-introduce one add-on at a time, image and see where the cross re-appears..",2
"Wow... Huge fuzzy stars. Must have been a night of poor seeing, and transparency..",1
"I agree withDigipainter.Use process of elimination first.Then, make a post on the imaging forum for more info before you touch anything..",1
"Thanks for the help. Ya, not sure if it was seeing. I will try your suggestions. Start with scope first to troubleshoot. Makes sense. Just have to wait for clear weather. It could be the light pollution filter..",0
"Mike. Just as a side note, flaring can also be caused by the camera chips micro lenses over each pixel, called microflare artifacts..  Tim.",2
"I have seen spiky artifacts on many images on stars. Most caused by filters, but I am hardly an expert.. Pinched optics should have triangle shaped stars I believe..",1
So many variables LOL that's why the call this Fun right (crickets chirping) fun!,0
I think it is my orion sky glow filter. Won't use it next clear night..,0
"Mike here is a link of what stars look like with pinched optics http://www.loptics.c...shape/pinch.jpg. usually happens in very cold conditions if scopes views are normal at moderate temps.. The following link discussing masking is relevant as I use this technique with standard camera lenses so I do not get spikes in my images https://www.cloudyni...sue-fix-thread/. I would go this latter route if the artifacts are still there, if they are, then I would again speak with the Vendor before attempting collimation.. Tim.",1
"I would of course recommend trying other things before messing with the lens. I would also recommend engaging Astronomics earlier rather than later, if for no other reason than to let them know you might have a problem, but are working through it. They may have some insight for you (seeing as this could be an issue that has happened on other scopes that they know how to fix).. I don't think stars need to look like complete triangles for pinching to be a problem..",1
"Gentlemen, I managed to get the scope out on a camera tripod, quick set up. First time with an eyepiece in it.. Just put in a Astrotech 1.25 inch dialectic diagonal with a Meade series 5000 4.7 ultrawide eyepiece. This yielded 107 power. I did notice coma in the outer maybe , 10% of the field. It was a slight amount though. It probably would have been more noticeable if I had been using a 2 inch diagonal along with a lower power eyepiece.. Anyways, the view with the 4.7 Meade showed a nice concentric airy disc when focused and concentric rings when focus was slightly racked out.!! Great news! There doesn't seem to be any thing wrong with the collimation of the scope. I could see Rigels companion. Sirius showed almost no color at all.. So I am pretty sure that the scope is fine. I Am going to take everybody's advice and trouble shoot my imaging artifacts by eliminating one filter at a time. Till I figure out what is causing my spikey stars. I am confident that it was either my light pollution filter or bad seeing, or a combination of both. I will keep you posted.. Thanks again for everybody's advice and help. Mike.",4
"Not to sidetrack the thread, but I think as we all go along discovering the limits of this fine new scope and our accessories we attach to it we must realize that the demands of this scope will be very telling on how we use it, what the quality of the accessories we attach, and our own practices I think it will be a very demanding scope.. as elmiko has experienced with what appears to be micro diffraction artifacts. I point to this thread which discusses that subject https://www.cloudyni...ined/?hl=asi178. - each setup will expose various problems, such is the uniqueness of our Hobby I am by no means an expert ha I can learn more from each of you then I could ever know. I find these challenges fun, finding solutions is fun, it helps each of us grow. I look forward to more clear skies, where I can push my equipment and this new telescope to its limits, as I am sure it will test me at every turn as well. My enjoyment is astro imaging. Looking forward to everyone's input, pictures and experiences using the AT92 Cheers to my fellow AT92 owners. Regards & Clear skies. Tim (Digipainter).",1
"Well this is disappointing. Last night I first-lighted the At92 with this flattener:. https://www.telescop...ors/p/99608.uts. I added extension tubes and obtained a distance of 56mm between the flattener’s shoulder and imaging chip; pretty darn close to the ideal 55mm distance specified in the flattener’s manual.. Using a ZWO ASI071MC Pro camera, with its 23.6mm x 15.6mm chip, I was not pleased with the degree of coma elimination/ reduction obtained.. The link that follows points to a 3m image of M45. No flats were applied so you’ll see vignette-ing. The image was reduced to 44% of the original but the overlays are unreduced sub-frames of the 4 corners and center. Notice the extent of remaining coma as well as its asymmetry, by that I mean the degree of coma and orientation visa-vie opposing corners (ideally, they should flare out at opposite angles). http://www.astrobin....ctor&real=&mod=. Now, it could be the fault of the flattener (internal collimation issue, etc.) but it isn’t operator error on my part - I have experience using extension tubes as they pertain to obtaining correct flattener-to-chip distance and all connections were “true” and aligned. I fear but hope it’s not the result of the focuser going off-perpendicular with the light cone due to excessive torques created by the flattener, extension tubes and camera.. Soooooooo, what are you folks using for a flattener (not a flattener/ reducer) and camera and what results are you getting, particularly as you move away from the center of the image?. Any input would be helpful..",1
"A question for you guys who are experts. I am not an imager. When you see coma in the outer edges, do you literally mean the optical aberration called coma (i.e., what you see in a Newtonian), or do you mean field curvature that produces stars out of round? Thanks.. George.",2
Bigbanger I am using the Astrotech FF2 $ 150.00 at our sponsors. I am not seeing any coma in my subs. But my field of view is8×6 degrees. Hoping to get some more time tonight to try and resolve my star spikes.,1
Fast fractors don't have coma. That is a problem with faster Newts. What people see is FC..,1
"Not true Chas. Coma is still present in refracting optics and must be corrected. Most if not all interferometric test reports show the amount of coma, with it usually below 1/10 wave p-v. It is not unheard of for some refractors to show actual, bona fide coma. You can see plenty of it in camera lenses as well, at all sorts of focal lengths from ultra short (like 10mm) to long (like 600mm)..",1
That is not what Roland told me years ago.. Try a Paracorr and see what it does..,0
"I looked into that flattener but chose not to buy it because it claimed to work for refractors ranging from f6-f8. (As you know the AT92 is a f5.5 scope.). Meanwhile, with my ZWO ASI071MC Pro I'm covering a 2.68 x 1.78 degree chunk of sky. That's fairly wide but I've not had this problem to this extent with other scope/ flattener combos using this camera.. Right about now I would love for Astronomics (I know they're monitoring this thread) to chime in and give some advice, i.e., yes, our FF2 should work. And if they simply don't know yet, commit to testing it and even some competitor flatteners..... From what I understand they're selling these in good numbers, many to imagers. Guys/ gals, HELP!. - Thank you.",1
"I don't know what Roland told you but I know he knows that refractive optics also suffer from coma. I would not expect a Paracorr to do anything useful in a refractor since it is designed for reflectors, but coma is coma, so maybe it would do something, if you could find a refractor with enough coma for a correction of it to be very obvious. Most refractors these days are so well-corrected for coma that it is rarely an issue, and usually only with images when it is present..",0
Far as i know it is just FC. And coma to me is a fast Newt thing only. Just never heard of coma in fast APO's..,0
"I have yet to own an APO, fast or slow, that doesn't present coma at image edges. (Exception being quads and higher count element APO's that have an integrated flattener.) And I've owned ones by Tak, Vixen, Stellarvue and Astrotech..",0
"Again, it is largely absent from refractors, but it affects all optics. It is different than defocus due to field curvature, which I suspect most people mistake for coma. But coma does exist in refractive optics..",0
"The AT2FF was the flattener that worked with the original TMB92 fairly well. There was never a dedicated flattener as Tom died before it could be designed.  At some point we will work on a dedicated flattener for the scope.  As far as other manufacturers flattener, your guess currently is as good as mine.  I don’t have a cache of flatteners to pull from and run tests on.  Weather has been garbage here so testing anything is out of the question at the moment.  I wish I had. Better answers, but the newness of the scope and the disagreeable weather patterns put everything on hold.  And to be fair, if there is an issue I would suggest calling us as I don’t always monitor this thread.  Currently I need to stop typing and get back to helping my daughter with her math and my son with a project.",1
"Thanks, Michael!..... That was helpful..",1
I am using the AT2FF with the asi1600mm pro That is the largest sensor I have and the AT2FF covers the FOV for this combo I have round stars out to the edges without vignetting. only time I get bloom or trails is when I screw up the guiding  I cannot speak for anything else. I do have a x.80 reducer/flattener I could try that at a later time. hope that helps.,2
That’s encouraging. The 1600 with the AT92 provides a 2.00x1.51 degree FOV whereas my 071 with that same scope provides a 2.68x1.78 degree FOV. Even if I get round stars up to the FOV your camera provides using my camera I’d be reasonably happy. Guess I’ll be returning the Orion flattener and ordering the AT2FF… Thank you!.,2
"Had some clear skies last night so I hurried out and set up decided to shoot using LRGB filter set so I swapped out the EFW mini I gotta get a 8 slot LOL anyway it added a piece of dust to the image so I had to shoot flats the next morning I didn't think and cleaned the LUM filter before taking flats so the big ol dust mote didn't get totally calibrated out. Oh well it is a learning process ;-). Here are two of my captures, I need more for M33 so I will do that later when it is higher and away from the **** packing plant and their LED lights filling the sky. Here is ""the EYE's, M84-M86"" Lum only and ""the Pinwheel Galaxy"" in LRGB, Yes I did trim away the garbage from stacking and trimed a bit to get rid of my poor tracking from a not so great PA I do not use the LRGB filters often because I am in a Red zone but here they are..",6

Tim.",0
"Wow! Tim, so much details for a couple hours of data. Those mono cameras are amazing. Great job on the capture and processing. I still have to process M 108 I captured on the same evenings.. Clouds tonight here too, rain tomorrow. Oh well, guess we can work on our processing technique.. Mike.",1
Great!... Says the subs were unguided. You using a Paramount or equivalent?.,1
I've owned the 178 and 174. The 178 is a good camera but avoid the 174. It suffers from excessive banding. They quickly become visible once you start pushing the Histogram.. Here's what I mean (click to enlarge)..,3
"Thank you BigBanger, Nothing special for the mount, I just took great care with the PA. I used my AVX mount for this. It is pretty good unguided when using short subs (1 to 3 minutes) but really depends on a great PA, Seeing and balancing of the payload. Some days I get it right.",3
"Ah good to know, I will do more research, ty BigBanger. I believe the 178mm-c will work great with the FC of the AT92.",1
Does anyone know if the AT92 withAT2FF will yield good images with a full frame DSLR? --Jeff.,0
It shouldn't. The AT2FF is merely a stop gap with the 92. The 92 is so fast that it really is outside of a fully corrected field that the AT2FF would normally produce..,0
"Hi Michael,. The size of a full frame DSLR is 36mm x 24mm. My ZWO ASI071MC camera has a 23.6mm x 15.6mm chip. I ordered the AT2FF from you folks yesterday and would like to know what kind of results should I expect with respect to coma reduction? (Yes I know, I will soon find out for myself anyway.). Also, by ""stop gap"", are you planning on producing a dedicated flattener for this scope?. Thanks!.",0
"We will work on a dedicated flattener for the scope. I will have to call in Roger Ceragioli to do the work from the ground up as Tom didn't even start designing one.. You are going to see field curvature on the outer edges for sure, how much I can't really say. I would guess the outer 7%-10% if I was to put a number on it. The flattener is designed for f/6-f/8 scopes really. I just happens to work really well with the 92. However, since the flattener first came out, camera chips have gotten much much larger. So we run into issue with expectations on the edge with these chips. A decade ago large chips were really available only for the wealthy.. Alan Dyer talks about the field and having a flat field for the center 15mm of his chip. He used a Borg85x reducer/flattener and made pinpoints out to the corners of his chip, which is the same size as your. Quite impressive considering the scope would now be roughly f/4.7..",3
"The AT92 looks similar to the Tak Sky 90, for which a dedicated reducer / flattener is available, that (I'm told) covers 36 x 24 mm sensors. Such an item would be great for AT92; the speed improvement to f/4.5 is really desirable.. When you travel to a remote spot, with not much time, you want to make each second of integration time count..",0
"Cool Mike you can put me on the list when it becomes available, I am sure the interest is there (mebbe the $$$ as well) in the meantime I'll keep using the AT2FF",2
"In preparation for an upcoming trip, I decided to check a possible travel set up, since this was the main purpose of my purchase of the AT92. I really thought I would have to go with something more robust than my TV-85 travel gear, given the extra weight. However, the AT92 did just fine with my DSV-M mount on a Series 2 Gitzo tripod. When moving the scope, vibration dampened under a second; when focusing, it took about a second and a half. Not perfect, but for air travel, more than sufficient. It worked smoothly enough that I didn't feel the need to try the larger or heavier mounts or tripods. Apparently the shorter length makes up for the heavier weight.. The AT92 loaded (diagonal, ATF finder, and 18oz Leica zoom) came to 10lb-10oz. The Series 2 tripod is only 2lb-6oz, and the DSV-M, 2lb-15oz. So, under 16lbs for everything, all in a very compact form. Looking forward to seeing how this scope setup travels..",6
I think it's based on the Sharpstar AR-90R which can be found online for even less. Sharpstar has a good reputation among chinese brands. Does anybody know who will be the manufacturer of the AT92?.,0
"It's been cloudy here in Phoenix, but I am hoping to get a chance to image maybe tomorrow night. Weather is supposed to be clear. Hoping to get some time on M35 Has Anyone else had a chance to look or image through their 92 Triplet lately? Mike.",0
"Yeah, right.. In addition to my Lumicon filters, I'm going to add a water filter to my kit.. Alex.",3
"Good one, Aleko!.",0
I have seen this effect with heavier triplets vs longer doublets as well on my Vamo traveller. The shorter triplet rides better and is much more portable..,1
"Last night I had a chance to first-light the AT92 together with the Astrotech AT2FF field flattener. The good news is, the flattener seems well matched to the scope. The bad news is, the flattening effect is “uneven”, meaning it works well at some frame edges and not so on others. The link points to a 12 minute (6 x 2min) image of M45; the background is the original image reduced to 35% of its original size and the 4 breakouts are its 300x300 pixel corners left at 100% of their original size. Notice the coma present in the left corners while to top right corner is essentially perfect and the bottom right corner is acceptably flattened (sorry, there was not a sufficiently bright star there to better demonstrate my point).. http://www.astrobin.com/full/392943/0/. I should mention I carefully created flattener-to-chip spacing of 57.5mm (the spec calls for 57mm +/- 4mm spacing) and I made sure the flattener-spacers-camera assembly was properly attached (flush and fully inserted) to the scope using the focuser’s compression ring.. I don’t believe this is the result of the camera chip being “off-perpendicular” to the light cone because I believe if that was the case all stars would be elongated with the same orientation. This effect is often the result of focuser drawtube sag caused by a combination of heavy load and poor focuser construction. (I only used a ZWO ASI071MC camera which weighs a modest 1.41 lbs. No filterwheel, filters, etc. were used.). My best guess is that the light cone did not hit the camera chip at its center. This would explain why the flattening effect was better on the right side of the image. Said differently, instead of the light cone hitting the chip at center, it did so right-of-center.. I await comments by you folks on whether my conclusion is correct and more importantly, what can be done to correct the situation. I should mention here that some scopes, especially ones engineered for imaging have the more secure and better aligning option of attaching flattener-spacers-camera assemblies via a thread. If my conclusion is correct, I’m hoping that option or similar is available on the AT92 and AT2FF.. Thanks.",2
"Informative report. Bigbanger. What camera did you use? Is there noticable play in the focuser tube? I looked at your picture, that is unacceptable. Hope you can resolve this.. Mike.",0
"I reread, you used the ASI 071 Is that a bigger sensor than your 183?.",0
Have you rotated the rig 180 to see if the aberration moved with it?Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk.,3
That idea did not occur to me. Will try that the next time I get a clear sky... Thanks.,0
"Can't you unscrew the compression ring back and get to the threads of the drawtube? Most if not all of the focusers I've seen from this manufacturer with a 2.5"" focuser allow you to do this..",0
I don't see how to unscrew the compression ring. It may well not be impossible. Equally important is the fact that the AT2FF flattener does not have screw threads so a threaded attachment does not appear to be possible..,0
"Wow, the flattener isn't threaded?? Seems like a glaring oversight to me. Threaded connections are basically required if you are serious about imaging well.. I would just grab the drawtube with one hand, grab the outside of compression ring with the other (where it flares out), and unscrew.. Here is a photo from the TS focuser page:.",1
"Not a glaring over site at all. It is a universal flattener and not dedicated, so it works with tons of scopes. Also, un-threading the eyepiece holder is so you can attach a camera angle adjuster 99% of the time..",0
"Not seeing a straight forward way to unscrew the compression ring I will wait for Michael (Astronomics) to confirm such action is possible and how to safely go about it. As for the AT2FF flattener, attached is the scope facing end of it. You'll notice inside threads (presumably for a filter) but not outside threads..",0
"I wouldn’t do that... Since the AT92 looks to have the same focuser as my AT102, there are three set screws that lock the compression ring in place. Back those off first and then it should unscrew exposing the draw tube threads..",0
Thanks for your advice but I will wait to hear from Michael before attempting this action..,0
At a stop light running my kiddo to the doctor. I will be back in the office in an hour..,0
"Of course you can still make it compatible with compression rings, but again, threads are important to eliminating tilt in the optical train. Exposed M48 threads would have made it even more universal - people can use adapters to get it to M42 if they need.. Just to clarify for others, when I say unscrew the compression ring back, I mean the entire holder with the screws that tighten the compression ring. That entire assembly (the metal adapter with screws in it) usually just unscrews, at least from what I've seen. I don't think the screws that tighten the compression ring do anything to secure the compression ring adapter to the drawtube..",0
"I understand, what I am saying is the reducer he purchased is a universal reducer so there would be no threads as many scopes don’t have that option. Especially scopes that were made decades ago.",0
Understood. More and more scopes do have the option these days so it might make sense to explore updating the design. I'm sure you've already got plans so I'm just typing to type at this point..,0
There is no way that I can see to take the compression ring off with any sort of ease. There appear to be three tiny allen head screws holding it in place locking it against the drawtube. I don't have a wrench on hand that is small enough. Looks like a trip to Lowes in my future..,2
"Michael, I have a mini-screwdriver set with various tiny bits. Do I have your blessing to attempt removal of the compression ring without voiding the scope's warranty?. Thanks.",1
"If you want to dig in you can, just tread gently as this will be a learning experience for both of us ATM..",0
I removed the retaining ring that locks in the compression ring (#1 screws) but doing so did not allow for pulling out or unscrewing the compression ring. I did not attempt to remove the entire compression ring assembly (#2 screws) because it was too invasive for my liking and also suggested that the compression ring assembly is flush attached to the drawtube and that had I removed it I would not find a threaded end. Attached is a picture of the back of the scope with references screws labeled..,0
#2 were the screws that I was going to work on..,0
The entire holder on my 102ED is locked in place with three Allen screws... not the compression ring screws.  The Allen screws keep the visual back from unthreading with heavy accessories.  I know because I’ve removed it.  I would be willing to bet that loosening the screws marked as 2 in the above post will allow the entire compression ring visual back to unthread.,0
"Michael, let me save you some time. I unscrewed the #2 screws, unscrewed the compression ring assembly and found that the drawtube is indeed threaded. The width of the thread is in the order of 2 20/36"".. While this is all interesting in its own right, it does not address the fact that currently there is no AT recommended flattener that exposes threads on the OTA side. Here are the pics..",3
You are correct. We will work on one in the near future now that the instrument is finalized and in hand..,3
"So ok, you have it removed, the threaded side of the AT2FF (remove the 2"" nosepiece) is M48. - get a step up/down ring for the scope threads to the female threaded side M48 of the AT2FF. then you can screw everything together as the rear (camera side is also M48 threaded. The rest of your spacer stack could then be screwed to the AT2FF as one solid unit..",2
"I be a happy camper, I'll deal with any FC for now and wait for the fellows/gals at Astronomics to create a dedicated FF.",2
"Wait, so there are threads on the AT2FF?.",0
It is threaded in the inside of the barrel for filters.,0
"Ahhh got it got it, missed the part about it being female even when you thread off the nosepiece..",0
"That seems to be the intermediate solution. The closest product I've come across is this adapter (see link at bottom) - M68x1 on the scope side and F48x0.75 on the flattener side. My rough measurement of the drawtube side was in the order of 64mm, a near miss. Perhaps Michael can give us an accurate measure of the drawtube thread so that we can go shopping.. https://www.teleskop...ale-thread.html. ***UPDATE***. Just found this more promising product. It's M63 scopeside thread (thread count not specified) is in line with what I measured. It's intended for Stellarvues, which I suspect share many parts in common with AT's, if not the manufacturer.. https://www.highpoin...a-m63m48f48-004.",0
"jay.i You can remove the nose piece from the AT2FF which is threaded (Female M48)and will accept a male M48 adapter, you can get a custom made adapter or a ready made adapter to fit the rear of the AT92 which is what BigBanger is wanting to do.. BigBanger I would suggest the custom adapter once we get the size and thread pitch of those exposed threads, or you could just do the old trial by error method and buy a few different male threaded step down adapters. Would be interested in the actual size, I am betting it's a standard M size and pitch size of 0.75 is probably right. I'd give the SV adapter you have linked to a trydo let us know your findings.. clear skies everyone.",2
The SV adapter has been ordered and is due tomorrow. I should know quickly if this is the solution and will share results on this thread..,2

Would a fully retracted in focuser tube vignette the image any?.,0
"Mechanically, I’ve succeeded in eliminating the compression clamp and can now attach a camera to the AT92 entirely using threaded attachments.. Here are the steps (see attached image).. 1. Remove these two components from the draw tube. One (the outer one) uses philips head screws, the other flathead screws to secure these threaded-in components.. 2. Buy and install this Stellarvue 63 mm Male to 48 mm Male/Female Adapter. 3. Remove the AT2FF’s nosepiece and screw it into the Stellarvue adapter. 4. These are the 40mm (2 x 20mm) extension tubes my camera needs to reach the required 57mm +/- distance between the back edge of the AT2FF and camera chip. (My ZWO ASI071MC’s chip is set back 17.5mm.). 5. This was just a rough way for me to assure that with all the part swapping I did I could still reach focus. (I won’t have clear skies till Monday night for confirmation.) It was 6.5” from the front edge of the draw tube to the front edge of my camera body before the swap and I was able to extend the draw tube (with some spare capacity) to that distance after the swap.. This is all well and good but the real deal is, will it solve the one-sided coma my images displayed after I added the AT2FF to my mix.. - Avi.",5
Hey Thanks Avi for the great breakdown! Only difference I did in ordering the parts you describe above is to add in 2 x 30mm 48mm extensions. I will put these between the ATFF and the Stelarview adapter so I can keep the focuser from being so extended. Looking forward to seeing your image tests. I was hoping for some clear skies here but that won't happen until Monday or Tuesday..... Keith.,2
"Thanks, Keith!. That's an excellent idea. I'm hoping to see a significant improvement in the resulting images before I spend more money on this build.. - Avi.",1
"Keith,. Thinking more about your idea it occurred to me that the AT2FF's nosepiece is itself an M48 threaded extension tube. Once I added it back into the mix I was able to significantly reduce the drawtube's extension. Here is the resulting assembly, showing only a moderately extended drawtube.. In fact, the drawtube is even less extended using this new assembly than it was back in the day I was using the compression clamp; 37mm vs 42mm. This is a double win, no more compression clamp and a reduction in the drawtube extension.. Thanks again, Avi.",2
"Avi Glad to see the SV 63/48 adapter worked (I ordered one) I am going to assume at some point you will insert a filter wheel (20mm) into the mix in area #4 eliminating one of your 20mm spacers?. -- ""4.

You also might think of incorporating a field rotator like I did ahead of the AT2FF I used the ""Astro-Tech AT60ED Camera Angle Adjuster"" which seems solid enough to support the asi1600 + mini EFW and AT2FF without any sag that I can detect once it is locked down after positioning the cameras FOV.. anyway FB on your getting your rig together looking forward to some photos from you Avi. Clear Skies. de Tim.",2
"I had almost an hour of clear skies before the clouds rolled in during which time I captured 6 x 2 minute images of M42. Here is the resulting stack using my new all-thread-attached OTA-Flattener-Camera assembly.. The result is that I now get more centered flattening, but it is not nearly as centered as I would have hoped for. In this constructed image (the background is the main image reduced to 37% of its original size while the corners have left at original size….. the center of the image has also been isolated -- located on top -- and left at its original size) you can see that the top left corner shows very little come while the other 3 corners show moderate, properly oriented comas.My conclusion is that the light cone is still not converging at the center of my camera’s chip. There is some corroborating evidence of this in the flats I created (also attached below) to calibrate the image. Notice that the brightness fall-off is asymmetric at the 4 corners, suggesting that the light cone converges a bit left of center.This is the link to the full resolution image for reference.http://www.astrobin....ctor&real=&mod=. Also, a reminder to click on the attached thumbnails to see them at their uploaded resolution.. Please share your throughts.Thanks, Avi.",1
Is it possible that the chip itself is not centered properly in the camera?.,0
Great documented analysis.. Is there any correlation between the position of the imaging train with respects to up and down (gravity) and the two images that are likely to be at different time/position.. The thinking (to discount) is whether the imaging train load (which is always long) induces some minor play in the focuser alignment?.,1
"Hey Avi -. - I am curious, you have zeroed out the ZWO ASI071's built in tilt adapter ? I would also assume the APS-C size sensor would show more Field Curvature then my 1600's Four Thirds size sensor at the edges. - the other question I have, is I initially only used 45mm of draw tube to focus with nothing ahead of the field flattener, yet should I assume in your photo you initially used more than 75mm to reach focus? (without the adapter screwed on the front of the FF) , the gross difference in required draw tube extension seems odd to me.. Tim.",0
"I will ask again, have you rotated your gear to see if the aberration has moved? This will help narrow things down. It is a needed step..",2
I forgot to add that question Mike. I would also be interested to see if another like camera produced similar results.. Tim.,1
"I have not. I addressed the possibility of poorly attached camera/ flattener assembly via the compression ring by eliminating the compression ring and going entirely with threaded attachments. In addition, I reached focus with the drawtube only extended out by about 37mm. I also kept the weight down by not introducing a filter wheel, OAG or other item into the mix.. If you still feel there is value in me imaging at 90 and 180 degree rotations I'll do so tonight. Keep in mind, with the compression ring out of the picture I will be rotating the entire focuser, not just the camera/ focuser.. I await your reply.. Thanks, Avi.",0
There would be value to the camera moving. If the aberration moves with the camera moving then it will tell us there is a problem with the camera itself or something internal to the camera. It really is an important step in seeing where the issue actually lies..,0
Will test tonight and rule in/ out that possibility..,0
"Hi Tim,. I have not touched the camera's tilt adapter. It's currently set at factory default. In any event, I don't believe this is a tilt issue. If it is, all stars, including the ones at the center of the image would be affected.. I'm not sure what you're asking. The image of M42 I posted this morning had the drawtude extended out by only about 37mm. And here again is what the assembly looked like.. - Avi.",0
"Will do.. And FYI, I hope it's not the scope because, unlike the imaging results I'm getting, I like everything else about it.. - Avi.",0
That makes two of us.,0
Will test tonight by imaging the same target at different rotation points..,0
"The initial photo of your rig prior to the current configuration (the 1st picture post #939) is what I referred to (not important). I concur with Mike, you would need to rotate the camera only to eliminate it as a possible issue. The tilt adjustment screws on your camera are intended to fine tune the imaging plane and I would have suggested you return them to the initial position and do as Mike suggested by imaging @ 90 & 180 rotations to see if it followed positing. I would still suggest trying another same type camera if you can borrow one.Good luck Avi. regards. Tim.",0
"Even better than imaging at different angles to rule in/ out the camera, I found a picture (actually a stack of 19 x 2 minutes images) I took on Jan. 15 of M36 and M38 with this camera, but using a Stellarvue SV70T/ SV 0.8x reducer-flattener. Unlike the results I got with the AT92, I found no pronounced flattening “bias” at the image corners.At bottom is that picture reduced to 36% of its original size but with the corners left at their original size. (Remember to click on the image to see it at uploaded resolution.)Here is the link to the original should you want to do a detailed inspection.http://www.astrobin....ctor&real=&mod=. To my mind, I’ve ruled out the camera as the source of the problem.. Agree, Michael?. - Avi.",1
"I don't agree with it to be honest. Different optical rig, different flattener, different sky coverage..",1
Also adding the flat used. Notice how the corners darken more evenly. An indication that the light cone is hitting the camera's sensor at center.. Just more evidence that the camera's sensor is well positioned.. - Avi.,1
Substituting one of your 20mm spacer with a variable spacer and another 10mm spacer would allow you to rotate just the camera. A few 1mm spacers might help.. Also being able to tune the spacing for the FF could change the distribution of the elongations. When the best effect is found the minimum number of fixed spacers can be substituted.. https://www.stellarv...ngth-sfe-m42-v/.,1

"Tim,. its been so long since my schedule and the weather have cooperated, I almost don't know the answers to your questions.. Without much time under the stars with the scope, I do think the 35 Panoptic is a nice match for the AT92. I prefer it over my 31 Nagler in this case. I used the 35P when viewing Banard's Loop unfiltered. For some reason, the 21 Ethos does not do well. The edges got a bit ugly in this one. On the higher power end, the 5mm Pentax XW, with ~1mm exit pupil at 100x is excellent; I could spend a whole night doing doubles with just the AT92 and the 5XW. Hopefully there will be more to report, if things ever clear. But those are my impressions so far. I plan on using the scope for visual only. Alex.",4
"Thanks Alex.  I do not have anything as exotic as the TV line of EP's I do have a few Duo EP's nothing in the 25mm or above range my budget range would be in the Hyperion or ES or something along those lines in the $200 range a 35Pano would be nice but I'd have to hock my leg or find an awesome deal on CN LOL again thanks for the input.

"On my TMP92, which is similar to the AT92, I also find I like the 31 Nagler better than the 21 Ethos. I don't have the 35 Panoptic to compare. Most eyepieces have some slight curvature at the edge, and I expect that the 31N and 35Pan curve one way and the 21E curves the other way. So the 35Pan and 31N make up for some of the 92's curvature (perhaps the 35Pan more so), and the 21E probably adds to it. In my Newtonians with a Paracorr, the 21E looks perfect, so I am guessing they curve slightly the other way. (Or could be that the 21E and Newtonian-Paracorr are both flat.). George.",2
We need a Paracorr that eats FC..,1
"I believe you're right George. In my f5.5 refractors in the past, certain eyepieces would perform very well when others not so great.. 27 pan was beautiful in these scopes, where as the 20T5 didnt perform so great. You just have to find what works for your scope at these focal ratio..",1

"I have read this thread with interest. Many are using this for AP, but I'd like some comments about visual.. I am mostly a lunar planetary observer. I'm a fan of the AT72, and especially the new AT60, which is a dynamic and versatile little scope. I'd like a bit more aperture with the added convenience of portability. Here are my questions:. 1. Visual reports on the moon and planets?. 2. Any mountings on camera tripods or a Porta II, for example, and the ergonomics of same?. 3. I'm a refractor user and have never collimated an OTA, and don't intend to start with a triplet. I have heard no reports of the AT92 arriving out of collimation. Anybody?. 4. Anyone experiencing cooling issues, i.e., do you have any.. Thanks for the responses in advance. I love AT products, and am wondering if this is my next..",4
"I am still evaluating, but this morning I viewed Jupiter. Ganymede was right at Jupiter's edge at the start of a transit. Seeing came and went, but when it was good, at 72x Jupiter and Ganymede were sharp, and Jupiter showed good contrast. Things fell apart at higher power due to the seeing. Won't fault the scope for that.. I looked at the sun today too, and compared it to the TV85. I thought the TV showed slightly more detail and contrast, but since seeing was again variable, I can't and won't make any final conclusions based on today.. I do use the Porta II when using the AT92 at home, and it does fine. For travel, my Series 2 Gitzo and DSV-M mount are able to handle the scope.. Forecast is for cirrus tonight, but clear tomorrow night, so will then attempt a comparison of the AT92 and TV85 for the moon and double stars. Maybe this weekend for deep sky.. EDIT: I will add that a couple nights ago I used the AT92 on the moon. Even though I was fighting high haze and cirrus, I took Copernicus up to 125x with a 4mm ortho. Lovely detailed view of the alternating shadowed/lit curves of the eastern terraces, with detail showing on the crater floor..",5

"Sadly, the alternative is not looking at all. Combined with my Bortle 8 skies, that would mean that the only thing ""worth looking at"" is the moon, and many people don't even think the moon is worth looking at. I don't get to choose the placement of the planets or the darkness of the sky, and I won't move across the world to change their relative position to me. We have to make do with what we get..",2
"I have some super steady seeing in FL, but i have a house to my south so the heat from the roof ads to the seeing problem let alone Jup and Sat are so low anyways. If they are in the southeast i can do pretty good if they were higher up. I am sure the AT92 could do over a 100x per inch in my seeing on the moon and doubles..",1
"I really hope you're right. But until someone actually does it, it's still speculation. :-(.  Hopefully someone someday somewhere will get a chance to put the AT92 under a clear, perfectly steady sky to see what it can truly do.

I may still buy one if i get crazy enough. I can bet i can find out pretty fast..,1
"So, finally a clear evening that was only chilly, not frigid. A good night to do a partial comparison between the AT92 and the TV85. Partial, because with a big fat moon, about all I could see were Luna and a couple bright doubles. Being treed in made matters worse too. But you go with what the sky gives you.. This shouldn't even be a fair fight. A 92mm triplet against an 85mm doublet. But if the 92 is going to replace the 85, it has to earn its place in the lineup.. Kept it simple, but tried to equalize as much as possible. Both scopes had TV Everbrite diagonals. Low power in the AT92 was a 30mm Pentax, and on the TV85, a 35mm Pan, both giving around 17x. Higher power in the AT92 was a Zeiss-barlowed 10mm ZAO-II. The TV85 had a 6mm ZAO-II, so both were right at 100x. I hope everyone will agree that any flaws were probably not the fault of the diagonals or eyepieces.. The moon at low power: I would give a slight edge to the AT92. The moon seemed slightly brighter, with a smidgeon more contrast. The darkest of the maria seemed to have just a bit more pop. I was a bit taken aback seeing a bright, dark blue rim on the moon in the AT92, but swapping the eyepieces revealed that it was caused by the Pentax. The moon at higher power: The moon in its current phase is low on contrast. What better time to see which scope can bring out what little there is? In this test the TV85 achieved a clean sweep. I picked a tiny crater on the edge of visibility. The TV85 consistently showed it easier and better. I spent a lot time on the crater Aristarchus. It is very bright at this phase, but variations in brightness can be seen. Again, the TV85 showed more detail and better contrast. Same results on a couple of other areas that I didn't bother to identify.. Double stars: stars in general, really. Again, using only the higher power pairs. Nothing challenging here. Trapezium was already in the trees, and Castor and Rigel behind the house. So I went with Algieba and Mizar. This is where it got hard. The AT92 stars seemed cleaner in a way. The airy disks were a bit fatter, brighter and perfectly round. But I've also been bothered by the fact that I always seem to see more diffraction rings in the scope. The TV85 stars were not quite as bright, but the airy disks were smaller and the diffraction rings less noticeable. So in a way the TV85 was a bit more pleasing to me. The rings are a bit distracting on the AT92, at least for me. The reason I have either of these scopes is for travel to dark sites to have wide field views of star fields and nebulae, so that part of the comparison will have to wait until the moon gets out of the way this weekend. I've already had some awesome deep sky views with the AT92, but would like to have the TV85 along side to see how it holds up.. So far, the TV85 does not seem to want to give anything up. That it's competing well against a larger triplet speaks well for the TV85, while taking nothing away from the AT92. I don't expect to make any decisions or have any conclusions right away. It will probably take me the summer to really get a feel for which scope I prefer. And the AP105 will soon get thrown into the mix too.. Alex.",11
Great comparison Aleko. I'm curious how long the 92mm was let to cool. An air spaced triplet would take much longer than the doublet to cool. I can see this difference for example in how long it takes the star test to stabilize between my 92mm Stowaway and 100mm fluorite doublet Tak..,1
"Nice report Alex.. I recently did a three way comparison of the Baader 95mm travel companion, 92mm Stowaway and tv85. I was surprised how well my tv85 did against the other two bigger triplets. The tv85 lagged but nowhere near as much as I was expecting. Tv85s are great scopes!.",0
"Moshen ,. The scopes were taken outside to cool about 2 hours before observing. The temperature drop was about 20 degrees. (68-48). Enough time to cool I would think. The seeing was good, but certainly not perfect. Maybe the faster f-ratio can't handle imperfect seeing as well as the slower f/7? The nights the AT92 did great were very steady nights. I don't know enough about optics, just know what I see.. Gavster, nice to hear your TV85 hung in there too!. Alex.",1
"Have you done any star testing of the AT92 yet?. I ask because of your other reports of the relative lack of contrast on the moon, along with the eclipse debacle. Fatter Airy disks could be the result of a brighter scope, and the brighter surrounding rings could be rationalized in a similar manner. Such rationalizations are harder given your repeated lunar observations. Sadly, it might be that you have a scope with significant optical issues that make achieving pinpoint stars difficult, and which displaces too much light into the diffraction rings.. Some star testing might be in order..",0
"From looking at the Interferometer on hand, that shouldn't be an issue as far as optics go. All of the lenses are quite nice and this one is not different..",2
If someone has cloudy weather just send me a AT92 and let me see what it can do at 100x per inch +..,1
"Peter,. I have not had a recurrence of the eclipse problems. Someone mentioned it being easy to not have the collet square when inserting the diagonal, and I think that might have been the problem.. The moon last night wasn't bad in the AT92 at all. I just thought that the TV85 did a bit better. Star test inside of focus is absolutely textbook. Outside focus not so crisp, but I think? it varies with the seeing. I've had a couple excellent dark sky deepsky nights with it. And today, it gave very nice views of the complex sunspot group currently visible. But again, the TV85 kept up. It's not that there's a problem with the AT92. It's just that so far it hasn't yet distinguished itself from the 85. I'm leaning towards the brighter rings as being a result of the brighter image. Looks to be excellent seeing conditions tonight, so I may again do some doubles.. I should get some dark sky time this weekend, and am expecting that this is when the AT92 will show its stuff. After all, I didn't buy a 500mm focal length scope to do lunar and planetary.. Alex.",1
"Unless UPS didn't treat the scope with its customary ""gentleness."".",0
The scope came triple boxed. I don't see any sign whatsoever of a collimation problem.. Alex.,1
"Sounds to me like the difference in focal ratio, period. The main reason I moved from the f/5.5 TMB to the f/6.7 AP was wanting a truly crisp view at high power, and that's what I got. I can get Newtonians to be crisp at f/5, but not any refractors I've seen (Petzvals don't count as their objective lens is much slower). My f/6.3 130mm is very crisp, but nothing I have tried faster than that. I don't think it is just that the eyepiece cannot handle it, as modern eyepieces handle short ratios, and in this case it was actually a Barlowed ortho. I guess it must just be the higher tolerances required at the faster ratio.. George.",4
"Even with the full moon tonight, the improved seeing today and this evening made it worth a rematch. Again, the AT92 and TV85 were very close in performance. But with the seeing better than last night, the AT92 had the edge tonight. Trapezium E was easier in the AT92. Rigel B was brighter. Algieba was cleaner. In general, the stars were a bit brighter in the AT92, and the extra diffraction rings were very subdued when present. Most stars had the classic one diffraction ring.. On the moon, the AT92 again had a small contrast edge. Some say that contrast is not a very easily measured feature, so I'll spell it out. The maria were darker, while the highlands were brighter, in the AT92 than in the TV85. I also picked an area not far from Aristarchus, and under the higher powers, the AT92 showed more detail.. All these differences were small, but they were there. The TV performed superbly, but the AT92 did what I wanted it to do.. So the question becomes, why have I had such variation in results? From what I've gathered so far, the AT92 performs wonderfully when the seeing is good, but it tends to fall short of other scopes when the seeing is only average or worse. Are short focal length and/or fast focal ratios more susceptible to poorer seeing? Has George nailed it in his post above?. Alex.",6
"I hate to make blanket statements, but it appears that smaller aperture and longer focal lengths handle poor seeing the best.. It is hard to pin down focus at times with shorter focal ratios (it can be with longer focal ratios too). There are numerous threads on the benefits of longer focal ratios.. Everything is a trade off. That's the price you pay for better for astrophotography & EAA, better transportability, and lighter mounting requirments with shorter moment arm.. All three are serious advantages. It is up to the buyer to critically analyze what refractors works best for their needs. These are: their mount & tripod, their location conditions and average nights of good seeing, what they wish to observe and with what eyepieces, and whether or not they dabble in EAA or AP.. The best thing to do is buy all the refractors, long and short. Then you always have the right refractor for the right circumstances.",3
"I don't want to derail this thread by going too far off topic but I think this cut and paste from the article linked below answers the question of apparent variability due to seeing. I would say if we want to discuss this topic in more detail, we should start a new thread but just wanted to post this since the topic seems to answer some questions related to this scope used under varying seeing conditions.. ""Because the depth of focus is dependent on the wavefront errors of the optical system, and the focal ratio, it is therefore evident thatmore accurately figured optics, for a given f/ratio, are more susceptible to poor seeing, and for a given opticalaccuracy, short f/ratio telescopes are also more susceptible."". https://brayebrookob...epthoffocus.pdf.",2
"I agree with Tyson; I suspect that the f/5.5 focal ratio means good seeing is necessary for a really sharp image. Minor fluctuations in seeing causing even the slightest amount of focus change are probably causing diffraction rings to be more apparent, and blurring/fattening the Airy disk, due to the shallow depth of field at this focal ratio. I believe the slower f/7 focal ratio of the TV-85 yields a more stable image, so even if the AT92 has the better wavefront, it looks worse because it's slightly out of focus due to seeing more often than the TV-85.. This is unfortunately the reality of fast scopes and is why I think the f/6.65 focal ratio of the new Stowaway is a really solid middle ground that allows for stable views under average seeing, but is still fast enough to keep the scope short. A small refractor like the AT92 or Stowaway would be my choice for casual lunar observing on nights of less than great seeing (when I would pull out a bigger scope to push mag more), but if the scope can't provide a stable image in average seeing, then I can imagine myself being disappointed. Since my seeing is usually ~Pickering 5-6 with rare nights of 7-8 and the mythical once-a-year 9, I will probably have to steer clear of fast scopes like the AT92 (and Borg 90FL I had for a brief time with similar observations as Aleko)..",1
"The notion that a fast scope will show a fuzzier image than a slow scope just can't be the case, holding all other variables the same. Assume optically perfect scopes, one f/4 and the other f/15, with same aperture, operating at same magnification, with equally good thermal designs, and ideal focusers. I hold that there will be no apparent difference in image quality between the two.. Otherwise, every serious planetary observer would use a high f ratio scope. A superb f/4 reflector is capable of incredible planetary performance (from personal experience)..",0
"At this point, I feel that for me personally, no further testing or comps need to be done. The scope is excellent and does what it's supposed to do. Any scope will have limitations. I bought this as a pack and fly scope to take to the Southern Hemisphere, for the purpose of enjoying the wide field areas of bright and dark nebulae, and star clouds. The moon and planets I can see from home. My deep sky experiences with the AT92 so far have been excellent, so I have no doubt the scope will give me great views of the things I bought the scope for. When in Australia last time, I enjoyed the outstanding views through the TV85, but wished for a bit more aperture while still flying easily. This scope does that. Time now to make some astro vacation plans. Can't wait to view the whole of the Eta Carina Nebula through the scope!. I feel a bit dense in taking a while to figure out what was going on with the scope, and I really appreciate everyone's help and patience!. Alex.",4
"Agreed. In good seeing. I think the point that was made above is that in bad seeing, faster f-ratios do worse..",2
"Perhaps the main factor is focal LENGTH, not focal ratio. A longer scope, even at a fast ratio, is going to have a greater depth of field..",0
"I specifically mentioned seeing in my post as the reason for why a faster scope would be less sharp than a slower scope. I didn't say a fast scope will show a fuzzier image than a slow scope, everything else being equal (including absolute perfect focus).. That being said, if focal length was the same but aperture increased, to make for a faster focal ratio, you wouldn't have any extra field curvature, but the shallow depth of field would cause field curvature to be more apparent (the defocused stars at the edge would become more defocused). So, technically, you would get a less sharp image overall with a faster focal ratio at a specific focal length. The center would be unaffected but the edges would suffer. This is of course ignoring the fact that achieving perfect focus is harder with a fast focal ratio, and the fact that it's only relevant under perfectly still skies when the atmosphere isn't messing with your perfect focus..",1
"Focal ratio is the primary variable in determining depth of field, but focal length does play a role as well..",1
"As Steve suggested above, we may want to start a separate thread on this topic, so as to not derail the discussions and images particular to the AT92..",0
"I think the discussion of focal ratio and practical effects of a shallow depth of field are important to understand when considering a fast refractor such as the AT92. There haven't been many visual reports either, so I think it makes sense to discuss why you might be seeing what you're seeing, to give prospective buyers realistic expectations, for both visual and photographic purposes. I think most imagers understand that fast focal ratios mean their optical train must be very precise with regard to spacing and orthogonality in order for them to get a flat field with no aberrations (like CA or coma). Going below f/5 can be challenging because of the requirement for a sturdy focuser that is perfectly aligned and threaded adapters with no slop for every accessory in the optical train. Even if imagers achieve this, they may have to re-focus periodically throughout the night because of changes in seeing.. Visually, you don't have to worry most of that stuff, but the challenge in finding best focus as it pertains to fast focal ratios is important to understand, since it could mean you get a less-than-sharp view at the eyepiece, compared to a scope with a slower focal ratio with similar specs (like the TV-85)..",1

"And here is some good news for AT92 imagers, from Pete at Astronomics:.",1
"That timeline is not correct for a dedicated piece. We will work on a dedicated piece, but it will not be available until late this year if everything works out perfectly. I believe Pete is thinking of the generic piece that has worked with the TMB fairly well in the past..",1
"I agree that fast Newts are great on planets for sure. My best views ever were with 11 to 18"" OMI and Zambuto scopes with powers over a 1000x on my best nites with the 14.5"" and 15"" scopes i had. They were F/5.6 to 4.3 in speed. But i always used a Paracorr in them 100% of the time.. I find it harder to focus faster scopes vs slower scopes and FC in fast refactors and coma in fast Newts really bother me more today vs 20 years ago..",0
"This was specifically about fast refractors, not fast reflectors. Fast refractors are hard to design and manufacture perfectly, unlike reflectors.. George.",0
"Laid back and enjoying the AT92, although I am not a visual aficionado I do on occasion do some gazing I had a few great views when the rain clouds cleared of various targets and was very pleased. My old peepers aren't what they used to be and from what I understand that does play a difference in viewing as well as the many variables which make this ""hobby"" so challenging. So imaging for me is the mainstay, with all its many challenges and nightly variables that affect AP. Most of my experience comes from photography equipment (I am a rabid wildlife photographer) and as such I deal a lot with high end specialty lenses ""Big Guns"" I would say that this new lens (AT92) is much like one of the larger telephotos (500mm, 600mm) and the idiosyncrasies and handling techniques for imaging with them. Technique plays as much a part of making an image as does the quality of the lens. Precision instruments require precision handling I guess what I am saying is before we beat down the AT92, we need to take a critical look at our approach and handling of the AT92. Mike has bent over backwards with support and answers I applaud him for what he does OK, I beat my drum, sorry, but I had to. Love the discussion and enjoy the banter. The AT92 in my opinion is one heck of a nice frac A precision instrument that needs the best caress to exact the best view/image from it. I wait for the dedicated FF or FFR that Astronomics is working on I think the AT92 will fill the needs and please those who have it and understand it. anyway, Clear skies everyone the clouds are finally clearing here and with luck I'll have some stellar seeing with which to image with. 73's de Tim (digi).",3
Here's hoping it works out..,1

"The graphs look pretty bad, but it's hard to say if they actually are (because they could simply be zoomed in to what variation exists). The PV, RMS, and strehl look much better..",0
"The graphs are scaled to show highest peak and lowest valley. You need to understand the values they (graphically) represent before saying they ""look bad"". Most look ""bad"" as its scaled to show the peaks and valleys.. The ""Intensity"" are interference fringes that the interferometer produces as its measuring the lens. I have seen worse. The middle fringe is slightly kinked which dovetails nicely with the high spot just of center in the lens.. This is serial #0005, and would be a very nice telescope. I wonder if this IF is representative of the average quality of all lenses or is it an outlier at the upper-end? Since its on the website as part of the marketing effort of the AT92, my guess is its at the high-end.. I will say, if I could get a sample of the AT92 as nice as #0005, I will purchase it in a second.. I love small APO's.. (edited for spelling).",2

Has anyone fitted an aftermarket focuser to an AT92 yet?.,0
I put a Pegasus Astro Cube focuser on mine. If that's what you meant. Using it with the stock focuser.. Mike.,0
"I received my AT92 earlier in the week and one of the first things I noticed was how great the stock focuser is. Really - it is quite good. I am a FeatherTouch ""fanboy"" and IMO, there no need to replace the stock focuser. Now, I am not into astrophotography, so can't speak to it ability to hold the image train, but for visual it will do well.. I've not had it outside - yet - but will do so in the next week. Its currently resting in V-blocks on my bench. Tonight, I will run a few quick tests in double pass..",6
"I received my AT92 yesterday and had first light tonight. I am very impressed with how tiny this scope is and yet how capable. I viewed M42 low in the western sky. Beautiful with a 19 panoptic and AP Maxbright diagonal for 27x with an easily separated trapezium. I cranked up the power with a 8mm Ethos (63x), then added a 2.5x barlow (158x), then replaced the 8mm with a 4-6mm Nagler zoom (316x). The stars remained tiny pinpoints with a first diffraction ring. I then viewed M51 which was very well positioned and showed as a dim puffball with stellar center but the clouds came in so I played around looking at some terrestrial sites at high power marveling at the crisp definition. This scope is a keeper. Much better definition than my 80mm triplet and so very close in performance to my excellent 102 stellarvue but much smaller. I am thinking this scope can replace both of those..",4
"One thing I will add to my experience with first light, this is a telescope that needs the 2 speed focuser. Focus position is bang! right there! You know when you have it in focus and the slightest move of the fine focus knob either way more than a 1/16 of a turn gets it out of focus. This is a scope that would find a 20 to 1 reduction useful..",1
Thanks for sharing your experience. Which mount did you use?.,0
"I was using a Stellarvue M2 mount on a Meade field tripod, the same I use for my AP130. I’ll be using my Skywatcher AZ-EQ6 or AP900 for astrophotography. You could use a much lighter mount with this scope. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",1
"Congratulations on acquiring an AT 92mm. It's a beauty!. Any telescope with a focal ratio of f/5.5 will benefit from a focus knob with a reduction gear (e.g., a standard 2-speed focus knob). Compared to long focal ratio telescopes, short focal ratio telescopes are more compact, are lighter in weight, and are photographically ""faster."" But the price one pays for short focal ratio telescopes is an increase in field curvature and a narrow depth of focus. That's why an object ""snaps"" into sharp focus with short focal length telescopes. The ""snap"" indicates that the zone of focus is very narrow. Hence, such telescopes are intrinsically more difficult to focus. That's why I love to use motorized focusers with short focal length telescopes... not just for AP, but for visual as well. As good as 2-speed focusers are with short focal length telescopes, motorized focusing is even better (but more costly).. Conversely, long focal ratio telescopes (e.g., f/15) are easier to focus because they have a greater depth of focus, which results in a wider, more forgiving ""focused sweet spot."".",1
"Thank you for sparing me the trouble of writing all that. We should stash some of these things in a buffer somewhere and pull them out as needed.. I would add that at low magnifications any scope ""snaps to focus."" At higher magnifications (smaller exit pupils) you encounter the very narrow zone of focus and that this is often combined with the ""seeing ceiling"" which typically will be anywhere from 200 to 350x. Focus is not so easy to find in a GT130 with an XO 2.5 in the diagonal (~330x), even with the precision focuser. But even comparing two very similar scopes, one a scaled up version of the other, the C8 and the C14, if you're looking to reach focus at 200x it's easier to do in the C14 than in the C8.  The C14 is at almost double the exit pupil, and hence has twice as much zone of focus as the c8. GN.",1
"Hmmm... That's strange. AT92 equips very good 2 speed R&P focuser.. I would say it is as good as Feather Touch 2.5"" R&P focuser that I tried.. Here is from Astronomics AT92 description page.. Tammy.",0
"Please don't misunderstand my focuser comment as a complaint, it is not. The focuser is right up there with feathertouch quality and in no way needs replacement. I have had other telescopes with as low as a F3.75 but that was an 18"" and the longer focal length made the focuser tolerance a little wider. With this scope the focal length is 506mm and at 5.5 the tolerance is much less. The quality of the optics also make it obvious when you are exactly in focus and when you are not. This is just the first scope I've used where if the 2 speed reduction were double the normal 10:1, it would be beneficial. So no complaints and the focus is easy to handle. I am very happy with this scope in all aspects optically, and mechanically. Astronomics has a hit on its hands. I am selling my 80mm and 102mm and keeping this..",1

I look forward to the days when I can just remove a cover and flip a switch to get imaging. Looks like a few more days of rain/ weather in the forecast waiting to play with the 92 ;-). clear skies. Tim.",1
I’m at the star party a week early. Hopefully out of the 8 days I’m staying I will get a few good nights...  Today started out promising buts now totally overcast. Here’s my AT92 (#008) on its mount. Nice looking telescope.,10
Looks like a lot of fun Paul. My 92 is the one right after yours! 009.. Hoping for clear skies your way.. Mike.,1
"Oh, okay Tim, Fresno, that explains the high heat. Good luck with the Pier project! Show pics.. Mike.",2
"Nice Pics Paul, Mike take and post some pics at the star party ;-) (I know you will). more rain coming in I may need to order that special water filter yet!.",1
This is a link to my rig I used while in Greer Az It is a sleepy little community in the White Mountains of Eastern Arizona.. Elevation is 8500 ft. SQM 21.98!!!! I can't wait to get home and process my data! This is the darkest place I have imaged from.. Mike. https://astrob.in/407215/0/.,1
"Going home tomorrow, I will try to post some pictures later this week! Will have three full nights of collecting photons!. Mike.",0
"Had a few happy hours of clear skies this morning, so I moved the scope out to the mount and played, one of my fave Nebula was up so I gave it my time (1 1/2 hours) before I needed to hit the ol memory pad (pillow). here is the results I love the AT92..",3
"Beatifully done Tim! Such a cool target. I see the "" Pillars of Creation"".. Which camera?. Mike.",0
https://astrob.in/407700/0/. Here is a picture I took up in Greer Az Bortle 2. Mike.,1

And My Eagle Nebula. https://astrob.in/407585/0/. Mike.,4
"Thanks Mike I used the asi 1600mm pro, I was able to see the milky way just faintly last night / this morning, seeing was excellent and steady for my bortle 7~8 zone it is the reason I do mostly NB imaging. Wow ""Bortle 2"" can't even imagine, oh wait yes I can, I was over in Death Valley a few winters ago, they night sky was covered with stars from horizon to horizon.",1
Love it.,1
Just a friendly bump. Also wondering if there is any further word on the replacement trim rings that have serial numbers and correct glass type. It's been about 6 months now. Thnx.. Still enjoying the scope regardless of the ring though!.,2
"Since the AT92 focuser has M63 x 1 threads on the drawtube, it should be possible to connect the AP92 Stowaway's Dovelock adapter, and use the reducer and flattener lens for that scope, which is also compatible with the AP Traveler.. Now, whether or not it will correct appropriately is unknown, but wanted to put that out there for folks considering options..",1
I ordered WO stuff that will work with this scope (maybe) and will post results when I get back. I also have done some AP with promising results.,1
I saw the 92 in the flesh this week when the buyer of my SW150ED showed up. Looks to be well built and the focuser is better than my W/O 90mm. Seems to about the same size as my 90 F/6.2 W/O but shorter..,1
Finally back home! Here is the image from July 6th. C&C welcome,4
"Nice image Roger! Amazing for only one and a half hours! I own the AT92 also, love this scope.What are your skies like?Mike.",0
What do you make of the elongation in the corners?.,0
"Mike:. Thanks. Yes just 20 frames each channel. I live in the middle of Palm Beach Gardens, so this is full blown city skies with 2 street lights that shine right into my scope. Terrible really Peter:. Two things happened here. I was out of focus on the Ha data and therefore my stars are overall terrible. Also, the scope needs a flattener. Hopefully I can start experimenting with different combinations..",2
"Roger, thanks for the reply. I use the AT field Flattener. It works well for me. But my sensor is small, only 9 mm diagonal My field of view is only5 degrees.. Mike.",0
"I have the AT92. Nice scope, except... I have also seen the distortion away from center reported by RogeZ @ #1087 and rockstarbill @ #1081 and elsewhere in this thread.. My impression is that folks imaging with small sensors are happy with the scope, but that the scope has noticeable field curvature that becomes evident with 4/3 sensors (like the ZWO ASI183 used by RogeZ according to the tech card for the Veil), and larger sensors (APS-C, full frame). I have noticed this when imaging with my (APS-C) DSLR, even though I use the AT2FF field flattener; the flattener is an improvement over the uncorrected scope but by no means sufficient.. As far as I can tell from this thread, a dedicated flattener for the AT92 might one day be available, but it is not imminent. If anyone knows of a flattener that does a better job than the AT2FF, I'd love to hear about it.. Other than that, I agree with other posters here that the AT92 is well built, with a very nice focuser and many nice ergonomic details; and it is very sharp on center, with negligible chromatic aberration..",2
I received an email from Astronomics today. The AT-92 is on sale for $300.00 off valid through the next few days..,1
Website is showing the regular price.,0
Now it’s $1495.,0
"I see now, I added to a cart, and the price update reflected properly.. As for a flattener, as I mentioned before, since the scope has M63x1 threads on the drawtube, the Doveloc adapter that ships with the Stowaway could be installed, allowing the usage of the reducer and flattener for that scope:. https://astro-physic...section=product. The challenge is, they only sell the Doveloc adapter on their site for the 2.7"" focuser on the Traveler. If the Doveloc adapter for the Stowaway's 2.5"" focuser can be purchased as well, this could be a viable solution. One would of course, need to test it..",1
You finally did it Bill! You are going to really like the scope! I'm jealous that you got it for 300.00 off.. Mike.,0
"I did not buy it. I just checked the price. I have the Astro-Physics 92, so getting the AT92 would be a little redundant.. I sent a note to A-P asking if they sell the 2.5"" version of the Doveloc adapter. If they do, some brave soul can get that and the 92 flattener ($450) and test it..",1
"Oh, I understand. I don't have a problem with the AT FF. My camera has a pretty small sensor, 9 mm diagonal. So that Flattener does an adequate job..",0
"I am very interested in hearing a report. I am looking at retiring to the New Port Richie/Holiday area a few years from now and I am very interested in any reports on equipment and viewing. As a matter of fact, we are vacationing in Clearwater Beach the first week of September and I plan to spend a little more time scoping out areas to live..",1
Stay away from west Pasco. It is all drugs and low class renters. Homes are under 60k for a reason..,1
Let me know if AP responds. Could PP make the adapter?. Thanks.,0
"I just could not resist the discounted price so I ordered the scope today!  Fair warning to those living in the northeast, cloudy skies are coming.",1
"I emailed Astronomics about the focuser thread and they said they do not have that information. Where did you find it was M63x1?. Thanks,. Dan.",0
You are going to love the scope! I got mine back in January. I put a Pegasus Astro Cube focuser on it. I use it for imaging. The focuser is rock solid! Are you going to use it for visual or imaging?. Mike.,0
"Its in a post a few pages back in this thread.. https://www.cloudyni...at92/?p=9184335. Also, A-P said they only have enough for the production run at this point in time, so its unclear if it will become available for sale..",0
"Lest we forget, the AT92 is an excellent visual instrument and $300 off makes it a serious bargain..",7
"If you go north 30 minutes where we live it is an entirely different story. No crime, acreage homes for a song, 10 minutes from a beach, steady seeing but not the best transparency for deep sky. Best decision I ever made moving here. Weeki Wachee, FL. Secluded but 10 minutes away from all the shopping and restaurants you might want. 1 hour to Chiefland..",1
"I am planning to use it as an auto-guide scope along side my TMB 130SS. It will also serve as a travel scope or a grab and go when I want to travel light.So, I suppose it willget more visual time than AP time..",1
"That's a pretty expensive auto-guider, lol. So you will have a dual side by side saddle? That's what I use. My auto-guider scope is the AT 66 apo. Have fun with your new scope!. Mike.",0
"Looks like the sale is over.. Was considering it at the discounted price, now no more.. Would have been considerate of Astronomics to let us know the sale's duration.",0
The email that Astronomics sent out on July 30 said that it was a two day flash sale. I guess that wasn’t on the website?.,0
I never received such a note and I'm a repeat customer of theirs..,0
This is the email we sent out.  I suppose I should have put the actual stop date on it.  I apologize for the confusion.,3
I didn't get it either. Must have been some logic to promote to a subset of their list. -Phil.,0
"You might want to check the junk folder, or maybe the ISP blocked it. Who knows? I sent it out to everyone that is on the CN or astronomics list..",2
Why on Earth would Mike restrict this offer to a few?.,0
"I have gmail and it goes not in my inbox, but to the ""promotions"" tab..",0
"Correction: I did get the AT-92 promo email. However, something (unknown) about it caused Gmail to divert it to my spam folder, despite the fact that no other Astronomics email has ever gone to spam. I on a hunch went digging and found it -- too late though. -Phil.",0
I got the e mail..,0
Would you buy a 92 Chas?.,0
No way. I have a 90mm W/O i never use. I am getting rid of everything at this time and the house..,0
A fresh start can be a good thing. Can take time but it works. Having astronomy as my main hobby has helped me recover from PTSD..,0
I just don't view anymore or care to buy another scope again. Once it is all gone it is over..,0
Hope you get good prices for the rest of your gear..,0
"Wow, sorry to hear this.. I don't post often, but always enjoyed reading your reviews and commentary about the various scopes you bought and sold..",1
"I got the 2 day email on the sale buy I already own one. I bought it used out here and its perfect.. I'm not a big fan of the visual back on this scope.. I much prefer the the brass compression visual back with 2 thumb screws.. If there was a way to get a compression ring back for my scope, id buy that in a heart beat and drop the self centering back in the garbage....Ralph.",0
Done it all and seen it all. So after 250+ scopes there is not much left to buy or see that i have not seen..,1
"Hope you feel you can stay on CN all the same Chas, as Joe4702 says..",0
"Not sure i will be around at all much longer. Getting things in order. Insane that cable, phone and net has gone up to $213 a month my sis was paying and it has to go..",0
?. Where are you going?.,0
Please get back to the topic. If CHAS wants to post on CN we have the off topic observatory as an option for situations like this. The thread is about the AT92.. Rgrds-Ross.,2
What's been everyone's experience with cooldown time for the AT92?.,0
"I live in Florida and it's summertime but it takes about 30 minutes going from 75 and 43% humidity in the house to 83 and 75% humidity outside. I keep the cap on so that slows it down but if I don't, I'll get instant condensation of the lens..",1
Right now its 92 and 52% humidity so you never know around here..,1
Thanks for that info. It sounds like it's appreciably slower to acclimatize than my doublet..,1
"Dear AT92 owners,. I'm considering this scope strictly for visual use. I have two questions for you:. 1) How does this scope perform on luna and planets?. 2) Is there a significant amount of field curvature when using wide field eyepieces?. Thanks.",0
"1) Close to as good as any 4"" APO. It's exceptional.. 2) There is some but it's not bothersome to me. You can also thread a field flattener (I use the TSFLAT2 from TS Optics) into the nose of a diagonal. Works great for totally flat field viewing..",0
"So far, so good. I am in the marketfor a stainless steel counter weight between 15lbs and 23lbs. I had to sandwich a 5lb free weight between twoother counterweights to balance the two scopes with accessories. I guided and visually observed with the AT92 over the weekend. No AP with it yet..",2
Nice setup Warren! Be sure to post images if you do AP !. Mike.,0
The serial number is also written on a piece of tape adhered to thelenscell beneath the dewshield. Unscrew the dew shield from its base ring to reveal the lens cell..,2

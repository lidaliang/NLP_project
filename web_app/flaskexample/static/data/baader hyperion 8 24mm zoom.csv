"FYI, Agena Astro now has these in stock.  Mine shipped today.  Website lists them as being ""in stock."". Don't know how many they have, but I do know that OPT has a big backlog of orders for them.  Was told this by sales earlier this week.. Only putting this on CN.. Perry.",0
"Thanks for the alert, many will appreciate it.. Best,.",0
"Looks like telescopes.com might have some now as well.  My order is finally ""In Fulfillment"" after 2 months of waiting!  The ship time on the product has also gone from ""Ships in 15 business days"" to ""Ships next day"".  Get 'em while they're hot!.",0
"Yesterday Hayneedle (amazon) told me mine would ship. When I mentioned the long delay and asked if they would comp me overnight delivery, they agreed. Of course, on Friday ""overnight"" means Monday. But still. Looks like the dam has finally broken. I hope ibase got some kind of commission or thanks from Baader, 'cause it was his opinions that put me over the edge into buying one and I'm guessing I'm not the only one!.",0
"Hey dude !..Don't be giving ibase all the credit here !.There are other Baader click stop zoom owners that chimed in on promoting these fine fine units , & by golly , I want some commission too !",0

"Starrancher and I are still waiting for our commission checks from Baader, I hope it does not take as long as they took to re-stock the Hyperion zooms!   Yup, the dam has broken - it won't be long now, world dominion is within the horizon. Best,.",0
nothing in the mail yet! The Hyperion zoom  rocks:rockon:.,0
"Ernie,. Sky seems to be improving.  How bout Brian and I get to test drive your awesome zoom again???  Baader may just send you 2 more commission checks!. Joel.",0
"Baader, I can vouch for Tank, he too is a member of the cadre that valiantly fought for the hearts and mind of EP community members to make possible the imperial reign of the Hyperion zoom. Better prepare a big fat check for him too! Best,.",0
"Sure Joel, would be delighted to let you and Brian use my wondrous Hyperion zoom again; I remember the time when you both peered through it and watched your unbelieving wowed reaction as you viewed Saturn (still visible that time) and the starry night skies with the zoom and in unison said that the Hyperion zoom rocks! Now that the supply dam is wide open, world-wide invasion and occupation awaits as the HypZoom puts an end to the EP wars and an unassailable and unconditional victory is secured, hail Hyperion zoom!  Best,.",0
"Mine just shipped from Hayneedle after a two month wait. They took off 10%, presumably because of the delay. Good on them..",0
"Nice discount! If you ask for it maybe most vendors would be willing to give a discount, given the long waiting period and the order was not canceled.. Best,.",0
Mine just shipped yesterday too...$182.50,0
"That's one steal of a price for a brand new latest version Hyperion zoom, congrats! Can't think of any other astro purchase that will give as much value to such $$$ as the BH zoom.. Best,.",0
"Just received mine today. I thought I was getting a great deal as I ordered with a 15% off coupon. But apparently all of us that waited this long are getting a discount. Oh well. I did notice that is has a little clunk at the 24mm setting, presumably from the element group that has to move with the zoom.. Anyone found a lens light shield solution as it does not appear that the eyecup is the 'fold up' type.. Paul.",0
"Paul, it has a twist-up eyecup! It's not obvious but try this: twist the rubber top counter-clockwise and the eyecup will smoothly rise up; twist clock-wise and it will go down.. Best,.",0
"Brilliant, thanks! Now to give it a few hours to impress under the stars!. Paul.",0
Bas***ds didn't give me any price break at all!.,0
Call 'em up & throw a *BLEEP* !.,0
"Please post your impressions of this eyepiece after you use it. IS IT really better than say a Televue or a Vixen zoom???. I have narrowed down the my search to Televue, Vixen, and Baader. Comments COMPARING these would be appreciated..",0
"mine is in transit.  Can't wait.  Don't know about a discount yet, but I expect it is still worth it at full price.",0
"From numerous thread posts that I've come across, the consensus seems to be that the Hyperion 8-24mm zoom blows the TV/Vixen zoom out of the water. Here's a sample thread about it:. A more recent one from this  on Hyperion vs TV zoom:. This quote comes from one who owns all the TV Ethoses, all TV zooms, all TMB supermonos, most Naglers and TV plossls; in conclusion about the Hyperion zoom:.  The Hyperion zoom is the best choice!. Best,.",0
Congrats; you're right on the money when you say that the Hyperion zoom is worth every cent paid for!  In fact I believe it's still a bargain at full price given it's stellar (pardon the pun) performance. Enjoy!.,0
"Hello folks.. I just received mine today... have not had a chance to use it.. Thanks for the photo showing how the rubber eyecup screws up.  Do you generally configure yours with the 2"" nose piece or the 1.25""? I'm assuming the decision is based on the size of your filters (assuming a 2"" focuser).. thanks for commenting.. chuck.",0
"Congrats! The Hyperion zoom will work both ways (2"" or 1-1/4"") but is more secure in the diagonal when using the 2"" mode. No difference in views whatsoever. There's a slight problem using 1-1/4 in that you have to raise the zoom a bit so that the diagonal's set screws won't hit the base of the zoom or otherwise get a long-neck screw that won't come into contact with the zoom.. Both 2"" or 1-1/4"" filters work well with the zoom; the Hyperion zoom is the only zoom in its class that works as both a 1-1/4"" or 2"" eyepiece, a testament to Baader's clever engineering and sleek modular implementation.. And did you know that if you pull out the rubber top, it will reveal threads that will allow you to directly attach a DSLR camera by using an adapter? Cool feature!. Best,.",0
Just got mine today too! I just got home from work about 30 minutes ago and grabbed it off the porch. I look up and see a clear patch in the sky so I set the scope out to cool off (Zhumell Z10). I go back out 15 minutes later and sure enough. Here they come...   It was a beautiful clear day all day today too. Go figure....  I still have a chance to check out the Pleiades though! For like 2 minutes. Then it was over.  and nothin but rain and clouds on the 10 day forecast.    I was impressed with the quality and craftsmanship of this eyepiece though. Very nice! The twist up eye relief is fantastic and the movement of the zoom is nice with just the right amount of friction. I can't wait to see what it can really do..  Edit: I left my scope outside while I was watching TV and after my shows went off I wound up getting about another 5 min of clear sky to gaze at Orion before complete overcast rolled in! What a sight!,0
"Mine was ordered yesterday and left Cerritos, CA for Hodgkins, IL at 6:00 AM today - then on to northern Minnesota - the last 100 miles by dog sled will will be the difficult part!!  Actually I think the sled will be pulled by rain deer - spousal interpretation!!  Way better than socks and a pair of gloves - well quite a few socks and gloves! No discount no shipping fee.  :dob:",0
Does anyone know if it is normal for there to be some slack/play of the internals of this eyepiece? When I turn the eyepiece upside down and back right side up I can feel the internals sliding up and down ever so slightly inside. There doesn't appear to be any negative effects on functionality or degradation of visual quality but I was just wondering if this is normal for this eyepiece. Thanks!.,0
"In a BH zoom vendor's website can be found:. Since you have the latest unit, it might apply. But others have reported that their zoom is ""quiet as a mouse"" while one complaining of a ""clunking noise I hear from my zoom when I shake it up and down lightly-ish."" Mine has no such noise/looseness. If it is that bothersome to you then have it returned since it's under warranty. Otherwise keep it if the performance is there. Just 2 cents.. Best,.",0
Is it possible to use the hyperion FTR's with the zoom piece to get even more focal length options?.,0
"Afraid not; I have both tuning rings and they can only be used with my Hyperion 21mm (or other Hyperions except the 24mm), and not with the zoom. But you can swap parts between the zoom and the 21mm, wherein the zoom becomes a 4-12mm while the 21mm becomes a 32mm widefield. Just remove the nosepiece of the 21 and put in front of the zoom's smythe lens. The 21 without the nosepiece becomes a 32mm..  Best,.",0
Thanks for the info..,0
If I shake mine lightly I can hear (and feel) some internal movement. My guess is that this is normal..,0
Mine rattles a bit too So does my buddies.,0
"My Baader Zoom is scheduled to arrive from OPT on Monday, Nov. 16th.  Now I need to consider whether or not to sell my Zhumell Zoom.  It was a good little work horse, very good for the money, but it's no Baader!    Advantage Baader:  Larger AFOV throughout the range of magnifications, 1-1/2"" & 2"" focuser compatible, 1-1/2"" & 2"" filter compatible, more parfocal, clickstop settings, probably better optics.  Advantage Zhumell:  About 1/4 the price!  I might just keep the Zhumell for quick, rough-n-ready, grab-n-go astronomy when I don't want to risk the Baader.. Mike.",0
"My first post here on Cloudy Nights but I've lurking for a few months. I just received my Hyperion Zoom today and am very excited to get it out tonight. Unfortunately, clouds are rolling in.  At any rate, I have a bit of a problem with it and I thought I'd post here instead of starting a new thread. I have a WO 2"" dielectric diagonal for my little 5i and would like to try the Hyp Zoom in 2"" mode. Unfortunately I'm having some trouble mounting the 2"" nose piece. I have unscrewed the 1.25"" nose piece from the M45/M35 adapter ring (the narrow one with the knurled edge) and then unscrewed the M45/M35 adapter from the eyepiece. This leaves the female M45 threads on the eyepiece exposed. I'm assuming that the M45 adapter ring with the beveled edge screws into these threads and then the 2"" nose piece into the bevel adapter ring. Every time I attempt to screw the beveled ring on to the eyepiece, it starts to bind after about 1 revolution. I'm being careful not to cross thread and the threads on the ring seem undamaged but it's hard to tell for sure. As well, the other adapter ring screws on and off with no problem. I've tried cleaning the threads but still no joy. Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing a part? Do I have the correct adapter ring? It's stamped with part #2454824C.  It's not a huge problem as I'm happy to use the eyepiece in 1.25"" mode for the time being. All of my filters and barlow are 1.25"" anyway.  Sorry about the long winded post. I'm a newbie at this hobby and I thought I'd defer to the vast knowledge and experience on this fantastic site..  Paul.",0
"Paul, Welcome to Cloudy Nights!  Glad you decided to drop in on the forums.. Never apologize for a long post; you posted all the information needed for members to be able to assist you with your question.. Rest assured, you will get ample help here!",0
"Paul, welcome to the forums!. There is an illustrated step-by-step pictorial that I posted some time back about how to attach the 2"" sleeve/adapter of the Hyperion zoom. Look. If you have further queries just holler!. Best,.",0
"Thanks Hernando. I checked out your pictorial description and it's pretty much what I've been trying to do with no success. I suspect the male M45 threads are damaged on the adapter ring for the 2"" nose piece. I'll check with the retailer I purchased it through to see if a replacement adapter ring is available.. I'm not sure if there is any real advantage to using it in 2"" mode anyway other than possibly from a mechanical stability standpoint. That said, I mounted it into my 2"" diagonal using the 1.25"" adapter and it seems rock solid. There are no clearance issues either..",0
"You're right, 2"" mode makes for a more secure fit on the 2"" diagonal and the views are just identical for both 1-1/4"" & 2"" settings. Good luck with the adapter ring!.",0
"Joe, though I'm considered a bit of a ""heretic"" by the Hyperion Zoomsters.... My comparisons indicated it is, indeed much better than the Televue 8-24Zoom... My old TV 8-24 has been ""relegated"" to doing full time duty in my son's Pentax PF65EDA spotting scope, where it serves him very well.... I just never liked the TV in my scopes; mostly because I was, indeed, spoiled by my fixed length EPs I guess... but that is testimony in favor of the Hyperion nonetheless.... For the money, very, VERY hard to beat. I'm heretical, because I persist in insisting that fixed focal length EPs such as my Naglers and Ethos do in fact better it quite noticeably at identical focal lengths (well, duh!).... I think it is at its best in the shorter end of the range however... say, from 8-16 or 18mm.... If someone only has $200 for EPs, I can't help but think this is the best possible way to start.... It'll be a killer outreach event EP, that's for certain!. clear enough skies.",0
"I Paul, I can not understand what you are trying to do. I simply unscrew the M45/35 (the thin knurled one) from the boby of the Zoom. This brings the 1.25"" adapter with it. There's no need to unscrew the nose piece. There's no need to unscrew anything else from the zoom.  I then just offer the 2"" adapter to the zoom and screw it home. Regards  Peter..",0
That's what I say.,0
"Sounds like I was a little overly ""detailed"" in my original post and I did include some unnecessary steps. Anyway, I've been trying to do what you've described since I received the eyepiece yesterday but the 2"" adapter won't screw in more than a turn and a half before binding. I can get maybe another half turn by forcing it but I don't want to push my luck past that. Upon close inspection of the threads on the 2"" adapter, I've noticed a rough spot so I think the threads are damaged. I'll be talking to the retailer to see if I can get a replacement 2"" adapter.. Thanks away for the help..",0
I just ordered one from Hayneedle and I'm on the waiting list!. Clear Skies!.,0
"Got mine from telescopes.com on Thursday.  Clouds kept me from using it until last night, and I must say I love it so far.  The wide FOV is gorgeous.  Comparing it with my Zhummel plossls, this really blows them away.  Looking at Jupiter last night, not only was I able to keep it in my FOV for longer, it seemed that there was a lot more contrast and the storm belts seemed to have much more definition.  M31 was nice, but LP keeps it from being to great in my backyard.  Albireo was gorgeous, as was the double cluster.  All in all, I couldn't be happier with the purchase..",0

"Hey Hernando,. Have you used the zoom as daytime eyepiece? I've been thinking of getting one for my 80mm ED that I primarily use as a spotting scope for birding ect.. Does this EP have much pincushion distortion, or false color around the field stop in daytime use?. Anyone else use theirs during the day?.",0
"Yes I have, works great! No unacceptable false color but pincushion is there although not any much more than the Naglers'. Here's a raw image taken with the Hyperion zoom @ 8mm with a Canon DSLR on an ST80 refractor:. Big advantage in that the EP will allow you to quickly zoom in on your subject before it flies away, just put your birdie somewhere on a branch in pic. Best,.",0

Hope things turn out O.K for you Paul. Lets know how you get on.. Peter..,0
"SUCCESS! I've performed a little surgery on the 2"" adapter by carefully running an Exacto knife blade through the threads to clear out what appeared to be some very fine metal shavings. I then applied a tiny dab of bearing grease to the threads. The 2"" adapter now screws on smoothly. Now if I could only perform some ""surgery"" on these clouds....",0

"Hello guys.. I used mine for the first time last night and really enjoyed it. But now I have a question..  While experimenting last night I also used the zoom with a Zhumell 2x barlow. It seemed to work fine but it appeared the image was a little darker on some dim objects. I would imagine that darker image is normal since I'm adding more in the light path, correct? Also, in the LONG zoom thread from awhile back, they were using the HYPERION 21mm eyepiece lens mounted on the zoom to achieve a 4-12 zoom. What would be the difference using the 21 mm eyepiece vs my 2x barlow?. thanks for the info.. chuck.",0
"Any time you double the magnification weather using a Barlow or otherwise , the Image is going to dim As you magnify , you spread the light available that any given aperture is capable of grabbing across a larger image , thus spreading the same amount of light over a wider area.",0
"Like Starrancher said; and estimates vary but the 21mm nosepiece will approximately give the same magnification as with a 2x barlow. Looking at an image of your Zhumell 2x barlow from a googled stock photo, it is most probable that you can un-screw the bottom element and use this to screw back onto the Hyperion zoom's nose thereby giving you around 1.5x which should result in a brighter image (although lower magnification) than using the entire barlow, like this:. The nosepiece above comes from a similar Celestron 2x barlow. Less cumbersome and more compact; just be careful that the nosepiece does not hit the mirror of your diagonal. Hope this helps.. Best,.",0
"Thanks guys. I took notice again tonight. If i click to the 12 mm setting and observe the light (no barlow) and them add the 2x barlow at the 24 mm setting (which should now actually be 12 mm due to the barlow) I notice a difference in brightness, especially on dim objects (tonight i was observing at a faint galaxy). Yes I can remove the bottom lens on the barlow so I'll try the above technique and see if it makes a difference in the brightness for me.. I appreciate the help.. chuck.",0

"Gentlemen,.  I don't post here often as astronomy isn't exactly my cup of tea. I am more of a daytime optics user. I did want to chime in here though on this thread to relate my experiences with the Baader Hyperion zoom..  After doing quite a bit of reading here on Cloudy Nights and after suggestions from Henry Link I decided to order one of the Hyperion zooms to use with my Zeiss Diascope 65. Henry's review of the Baader in comparison with the Zeiss zoom, in particular, is what led me to purchase the eyepiece. I wanted improved performance over the Zeiss in two key areas...color representation and edge of field performance. I am very happy to say that the Baader delivers in these two areas in spades. I am very happy with its optical performance and do consider it superior to the Zeiss in these two areas..  Like many of you here I find myself with the Baader zoom as my default eyepiece. The overall optical quality is excellent and certainly comparable to much more expensive fixed focal length eyepieces even in regards to wider fields of view at the lower end of its focal range..  In addition to using it on the Zeiss I have also been experimenting with it on the Celestron Ultima 65 ED. The Baader's usefulness in mounting directly onto the Celestron/Synta scopes is a huge bonus as I can use it on both scopes with little trouble.  One thing I have learned from this adaptability is how important the eyepiece design is in ultimately determining the scope's overall performance. With the Baader mounted on the relatively inexpensive Celestron ED the overall optical performance is comparable to the Zeiss/Baader combo but at substantially less cost. The only optical characteristic that I think the Zeiss still dominates is in the apparent brightness level. Other areas such as CA control, contrast, edge performance, etc... all seem to be entirely comparable..  Definitely an excellent eyepiece that I am very proud to own. At $200 it is a steal..",0
"Frank  no one could have said it any bit better, thank you very much for posting your impressions of the zoom ,  it's bound to become classic - one of the most important testimonials to the unsurpassed value of the Hyperion zoom. Such is a new landmark! Best,.",0
"I have an Owl ED 2"" 2x Barlow that has a lens unit which can be unscrewed and used separately for 1.5x. The effective focal-length range on the Baader Zoom would decrease from 24mm-8mm to 16mm-5.3mm. The magnification range in my 10"" Newt (1200mm fl) would increase from 50x-150x to 75x-226x..  Mike.",0
I think it would be more like 6mm-18mm.,0
I've always been intrigued by this EP. But for some reason I can't get myself to order one... could it be that I'm afraid to find out that a $200ish dollar EP is a match for my more expensive glass? I do like the convenience and high contrast views of the Nagler zoom so I know that zoom designs can deliver the goods. But then again I am partial to wide field views!.,0
"Have a generic 2"" ED 2x barlow, will try that, thanks for posting about it.. Best,.",0
"I am interested in pursuing something like what Sarkikos mentioned above but potentially in the opposite direction (more magnification).

"johnny,. Good catch.  Of course, I should have divided by 1.5, not multiplied.  24mm-8mm decreased to 16mm-5.3mm is more like it.  I must have been thinking about the increase in magnification.  In my 10"" Newt (1200mm fl) the magnification range would change from about 50x-150x to 75x-226x.  I think I got it right this time.  Mike.",0
"Wow Frank, that would be great! Nexstar author Mr. Mike Swanson addressed me in a thread that he has two of them for his binoviewer and the duo works well, given certain guidelines. If you get a second Hyperion zoom, let us know how it goes with a bino. Thanks.. Got word that one (maybe more) of the Hyperion vendors is selling these separate nosepiece-only units, will look for the email but checking out with the main distributors may be it. Guessing if they really are available, maybe it's from surplus good parts.. The Hyperion zoom is really fun to fiddle with, lots of things you can do with it. Enjoy!. Best,.",0
"Oh man. I have to admit that I've been a bit brainwashed by premium EP marketing and my own desire to justify expensive EP's. If Televue came out with this exact same EP as the BH zoom I would have ordered it in a heart beat with no hesitation. Granted TV has a long history of excellent EP's, some would say ground breaking design/re-designs, and their quality control is top notch but still...   maybe ordering the BH zoom would be good therapy. Haha.",0
"Frank,. My bad.  Of course, the 1.5x nosepiece from the Owl Barlow screwed onto the end of the Baader Zoom in 2"" mode would decrease the effective focal length and increase the magnification. 24mm-8mm decreases to 16mm-5.3mm. The magnification range in my 10"" Newt (1200mm fl) would increase from about 50x-150x to 75x-226x.. I will try to proofread more carefully before I post.  Mike.",0
"Yep, that's what I've done with my Celestron Barlow lens.. If you want to filter. Screw the filter to the EP then attach the lens to the filter..",0
"Over the years, I've tried this trick of unscrewing the lens cell from Barlow lens assemblies and then screwing the lens onto the end of an eyepiece to achieve a lower magnification than the entire Barlow yields.  Most of the time it hasn't worked out for me.  For instance, the lens from an old Meade Model 140 2x Barlow would not thread onto any eyepiece.  (Why am I not surprised?  I've had a lot of trouble with incompatible threading on Meade accessories.) Also, the lens on a Zhumell 3x Barlow would not screw onto any eyepiece.  My Burgess Binoviewer has an OC lens that has several extension rings.  When used in the binoviewer with the rings, the OC lens is about 1.9x. The Burgess OC is very compatible with all my 1.25"" eyepieces, filters, and such.  It would make a worthy experiment to find out the true field of view of an eyepiece when used with different numbers of extension rings on the OC.  I could use that information to help determine the magnifications that the OC produces in those combinations.  I think, though, that the OC by itself will probably yield about 1.5x when screwed onto an eyepiece.. Mike.",0
"The 1.6x barlow nosepiece that comes with my William Optics binoviewer also works well with the Hyperion zoom:. Best,.",0
"Mine arrived today. I'll be doing some comparisons against fixed focal length eyepieces at a few matching, or near matching, focal lengths. For 8mm click stop, an Pentax 8.5 XF and TMB Planetary 8mm, at 12mm click stop a 12mm Televue Nagler T4 and 12mm Astro Tech Paradigm. At the 18mm setting I only have 1 eyepiece an 18mm AT Paradigm. The rest of the focal lengths I'm more than 1mm off so I'll through them into a mini-review to submit to CN or post here.  Hopefully I'll be able to try all of those combos in the 11"" f/10 SCT, 10"" f/4.9 Dob, and SV f/6 70mm ED scopes I have and let you know the results..  So far, it looks puuurty on the outside. Does have a small rattle, doesn't appear to impact motion or view during daytime..  I'll try to hook it up to my DSLR as well and take some snaps at various focal lengths..",0

It is a bit more noticeable after I twist it toward the 24mm position.  You do have to listen for it.  It's not very obvious.  If I hold the eyepiece a couple feet from me, I can't hear the ""rattle"" at all.  Mike.",0
"Hernando,. Whoa!  That setup looks a little shaky, especially all loaded on the diagonal.  Watch out!  It wouldn't be so bad on my 8"" or 10"" Newt, but still...

"I got mine today.  In daytime tests everything was super sharp on axis, but in my NP101 the outer 15% edge in 8mm up to 30% in 20-24mm was out of focus, it took a half turn of the Feathertouch to switch focus between the center of the field and outer edge. Also the zoom was far from parfocal, I had to turn the focuser almost a full turn between the zoom in and zoom out to achieve sharp focus on axis..  When I received the box it was kind of smashed on one end, and the EP box inside was not properly packed and was also smashed on one end.  Is it possible I got a defective unit?  All the bottom fittings were loose when it arrived and had to be tightened down - it wouldn't even ""click"" when i turned it - so I tightened everything back up and mechanically it seems to work OK now.  However the outer edges look really fuzzy, less so in full zoom but quickly after zooming out from 8mm it becomes bothersome.  The NP101 has a perfectly flat field, could it just be the wrong EP for this fast, flat scope?  Any suggestions welcome..",0
"Hi Johnny, only used mine so far in f/4.9-ish dob. At 20-24 I see mirror flaws at 15% outer fov, similar to Pan 27mm and 25mm Orion Sirius Plossl (for general comparison). Only major complaint I have there is FOV, very tiny in 1200mm FL dob, Plossl (25mm) , and of course, Pan were much better..  It indeed is NOT parfocal however, from 8-12 its ""ok"" then the closer to 20-24 you get the more obvious it becomes, needs adjustment. Kinda ruins the experience for me..  I'm planning on a deeper comparison review for CN review section, only about 15% done so far....but I can say I'd keep the eyepiece for a grab n' go setup I'm putting together (have a 6 week old, not much time for anything else these days!)..  In your case, do you have another scope ? I wonder if the Nagler Petval design doesn't play well?.",0
"Hey Chris thanks for your thoughts.  I just spent an hour or so outside with the Zoom doing star tests and splits, and I am feeling better about the EP (except for the non-parfocal zoom!).  With my eyes semi-dark adapted and the scope cooled down, I am getting much better results at night than I was today.  There is still a little field curvature on the edges but it is quite a bit more tolerable (almost gone but still there) and the coma around the edges I saw earlier tonight has disappeared. I will say this, this thing is really sharp and has nice contrast, this is nice glass.  I still feel like I'm having to twiddle with the focus more than I would like...  could be too much coffee.   I'm going to keep testing it out tonight but right now things are at least looking much better than the daylight test I did earlier..  I do have a 6"" F/8 APO to test it in, but I'm still getting over a fractured pelvis so that's still a week or two away from happening..  I like the fit and finish, it is really nice mechanically and cosmetically and a perfect fit in a 2"" diagonal. The FOV at the 8mm setting is enormous.  Oh and mine does have the rattle..  Keepin' my fingers crossed....  UPDATE:  OK after getting a good look at M45 high in the sky I am going to have to send this EP back, it's apparent there is something defective..",0
"Johnny, thanks for the report, glad you're getting better results with the zoom, do keep us posted and I hope the hips get fully recovered soonest..  Although the zoom is not exactly parfocal, my adjustments to attain focus when changing focal lengths are very small and the earlier post saying it took almost one whole turn of the focus knob is definitely excessive as compared to other users' reports about it..  Best,.",0
"Thanks Hernando.  I think this unit was damaged in shipping.  The glass is amazing but something is off.  The stars in M45 were all either seagulled or out of focus with each other, even stars rather close to each other..",0
"Johnny,. the way you described recieving the eyepiece i would say you should return it if you can!. Saying that it didn't work properly (not clicking) these are not good signs!. Mine works fantastic in my f5.9 dob the, parfocal well its minor adjustment between FL.  1/16 to 1/8 of a turn between click stops!. I would give it another shot with a new unit!. Hope the zoom works out for you!.",0
"Tony well said!. Will have to go along with Tank, just hearing of the smashed box end upon arrival is quite jolting, not to mention other symptoms. As OP Jim in the original big zoom thread said, it's worth returning a unit until one gets a well performing one as it should be because this EP is a special one.. Best,.",0
"Yeah , sounds like you should send that one back Johnny Focus adjustment is minimal on mine even from one end to the other I use it in my f4 Schmidt Newt & the edge of field isn't bad at all.",0
"Hi Johnny, good call. I also tested against M45 for FOV and correctness, and did not see that level of star distortion compared to other eyepieces ~24mm (certainly no seagulls in the center of FOV, just outer FOV mirror distortion I always have). Things in the center were all in focus..",0
"Chris - The center was pretty sharp.  And some of the outer edge was sharp.  I was using an alt/az and let the stars drift through, some of the stars would be sharp at edge, then out of focus and seagulled about 15% in, then sharp again, then out of focus, etc.  It was random, so, I think one of the lenses must have got knocked loose. The relatively extreme focus difference between 8 and 24 would seem to confirm this.. Still, an excellent EP. It does vignette over 20mm..",0
I tested mine in the daytime in a SV-70ED and the center. focus was the same as the edge. Couldn't see any difference.. This was at 24mm thru 8mm.  Going to try and get some moon. shots tonight and tommorrow..,0

"Based on Hernando's enthusiasm, I ordered on Monday from Agena and mine arrived yesterday (cloudy)..  Got a quick chance to use it this evening on Uranus and it definitely lives up to the hype (pun intended)..  Also works as a good combination with the GSO 2"" barlow and diagonal mounted directly onto the rear of my C11 OTA  I found the eye relief to be a bit long - some problems with blackout initially - but then as other on this thread, I discovered the adjustable eyecup. That extends about half an inch, and cured my backout problems, a nice design touch..  Tonight was reasonably clear skies, some broken cloud but after yesterdays rain it was really too humid for good DSO seeing, so I didn't bother waiting the obligatory hour for OTA cool-down to ambient and used it for planetary only..  Compared with the cheap Celestron zoom I had used previously (which is from the same OEM as the Meade zoom I think) it's a huge improvement on FOV and overall quality..  I bought the Baader intending to use it purely for visual, but in fact the FOV is so wide that I think it might work well for AP using eyepiece projection. It has threads underneath the eye cup for that purpose, so my next step might be to get the EP-thread to T-ring adaptor, and see how it works for DSLR (shame they didn't include that adaptor ring in-box as standard).  ps. I can recommend Agena - I've bought a few of the GSO EP's from them recently - prices for new are good, and quality control seems to be excellent. Also, items with only slight dust/marks are frequently discounted on clearance. Free priority mail shipping for CONUS also..",0

"Like the straight-forward advice above about getting a Canon brand DSLR for astrophotography, books are a great resource in providing info about observing and astro equipment/accessories but here possibly is a monkey's wrench thrown in for good measure to thwart the OC's (obsessive compulsive) propensity and obsession to clean eyepieces and who would not tolerate any spec of dust on the lens whatsoever:. If this quote were coming from some obscure author then it would be quite easy to dismiss it; but (you might not believe this) it comes from the highly acclaimed and famous book TURN LEFT AT ORION (p.208) by Guy Consolmagno/Dan Davis. So what do we make of this controversial quote in relation to the upkeep of the Hyperion zoom eyepiece or any of your eyepieces for that matter?. When was the last time you cleaned the lens of your Hyperion zoom/eyepieces and with what? Best,",0
I definitely would never touch an eyepiece with that electric toothbrush thing.,0
"Usually the best thing to do is just blow the dust off an eyepiece with a rubber-bulb blower.  Never use canned air.  Never ""huff"" on it with your breath.  If you accidentally touch a lens or filter and get finger oils on it, first blow the dust off with a blower.  Then gently use a lens paper and a drop of good lens cleaning fluid to wipe the lens from the middle toward the edge.  (Always use lens cleaning fluid that says it is good for coated optics.)  Or use the papers that are already infused with cleaning fluid.  (Zeiss is a good brand.)  If an eyepiece, objective lens or filter gets dewy, take it inside your house and let it dry on its on.  Position the lens if possible so it is vertical.  If a mirror gets dewy, position it vertically.  But Guy Consolmagno/Dan Davis are substantially correct.  Avoid cleaning your optics if at all possible.  I don't like Turn Right At Orion, but that's another matter (the views are mirror reversed; not good for Newts).. Of course, all this applies equally well to the Baader Hyperion Zoom (mandatory on-thread remark   ).. Mike.",0

"My wife wanted a single, all-purpose zoom eyepiece for Christmas, so I bought the Hyperion zoom.  We put it in our 10"" f/5.5 tonight, and pointed it at the moon for a quick look.  Much of this has been brought up already, but here are my first impressions.. - It's pretty solidly constructed, but the thing has a dull rattle that I've read about.. - The zoom ring has a very good, albeit stiff feel, with nicely defined click stops at five focal lengths.. - Speaking of those focal lengths, I wish they would just do away with 24mm.  The sharp field stop disappears, and is replaced with a horribly fuzzy edge.  Almost all of the field that one gains by reducing the magnification (from the 20mm setting) is lost by the more constricted field.. - The other bad point is that the thing is not close to parfocal.  I understand that none of the competing zooms are, either.. - Views from 20mm through 8mm are remarkably sharp most of the way to the edge, and nice and contrasty.. I think this will make a nice all-purpose eyepiece for the 10"" out in the field.  The field of view at the 20mm focal length is about 45', which is adequate for finding objects.  At 8mm focal length, we have 175x, which will give good medium-high magnfication for deep-sky objects.  If the seeing is better than that, we'll use the nearby 3-6mm Nagler zoom!.",0

"I've often posted in the past that the Hyperion zoom can be thought of as an 8-20mm EP - it is well known that 24mm is not exactly its best FL setting but I still use it as a finder in that focal length.

"To update earlier post on BH zoom in cold weather, after 2 hour in 12 degree (F) weather, it freezes up pretty bad. Also the wind chill was zero so tonight was chilly.

Had to remove it and hold with two hands to get it from 8 back to 24 (gently but with a little force), no clicks of course at this point. Then it focused.

It's not problematic as it seems to only affect the outer edge....... otherwise it's tack sharp. I also noticed a litle outer edge pin-cushioning when it is zoomed to the higher mags. The verticle rod that holds our bird feeder tends to bend inward, something I can live with considering the versatilty gained with this EP..

"Don't really know if this means anything or not, but it's. too cold to go outside, so I have been playing inside. Here. are two pictures comparing a Panoptic 22mm with a powermate. for 47X and a Baader Zoom on same power. Dollar is about. 30 ft. away. Scope SV-70ED. Make of it what you will..",0
The zoom image is a bit sharper to my eyes. Most noticeable on the background around the head (who is that anyway?) and on his clothing..,0

"I've been useing my Hyperion Zoom in my C 9.25, IM 715 mak and WO ZS 110 refractor on Jupiter, Mars, Saturn and the Moon and I've been very impressed. The other eyepieces I've useing are Nagler T6s, a Smart Astronomy Zoom and Radians. The Hyp. Zoom, SA Zoom and Radians have been very similar as far a performance goes, detail has been very sharp and contrasty. The Hyp. Zoom gives about 65 degree FOV at 10mm and the SA just under 60, the Radians are 60. The T6s beat the Zooms as far as contrast goes and are a bit sharper but being able to dial in the optimal magnification with the Zooms can at times give them an edge. I just got a TV 2 1/2X telextender and it's an excellent companion to the T6s and Zooms in my WO ZS 110, I can really crank up the power. I'm trading in my 10mm and 18mm Radians in on a Pentax XW 10mm this weekend, with the Zooms there is really no point in keeping them. The 7mm and 11mm T6s are safe. David.",0
Put me down for a power mate,0
Hard to make a judgment without knowing how much of the images were cropped.. The center of the images show better detail in the zoom image. However there is detail in the upper left of the Pan image that doesn't show well in the zoom image. There also appear to be some processing artifacts in Pan image.. Both show pretty good and comparable detail..,0
"Agree!. Phil - thanks for the pics! What 3x barlow did you use in comparison to the Powermate? If it was a Televue 3x barlow, then the Powermate 2.5x will definitely be on my wish list. But from an excerpt in the book Astronomy Hacks (by Robert Bruce Thompson and Barbara Fritchman Thompson), p. 261:. Up until now I've not bothered with Powermates and only have the TV 2x & 3x barlows.. Best,.",0

"I just ordered one from Agena Astro and I'm anxious to see how it will work with the 2"" Seibert PowerMag Wheel.  My only concern is reaching focus with this combination.  Has anyone else tried this combination?.",0
"Hi Charlie,. Using the Hyperion zoom on my small WO66 refractor, I had to modify the 2"" diagonal by shortening the eyepiece-side lip to be able to use the zoom with a TV 3xbarlow:. Let us know how it works out on your scopes and Siebert PowerMag Wheel, there are very good reports about that.. Best,.",0
"After more comprehensive analysis, I have a better view (pardon the pun) of the on and off axis performance of this EP. These opinions of mine again come courtesy of having this EP hooked up with my little Vixen and are based solely on terrestrial viewing. The clouds and fog have not cleared here in over a week which would be on par for a new equipment curse scenario. In other words, I haven't yet had a chance to look through the 12"" Dob.. This EP is the Bomb!   I find that it is tack sharp on and off axis. Where I was originally not pleased with off axis performance, I found that eye placement is VERY important with this EP. A few twists of the adjustable eyepiece cup and voila, problem solved. Yep, this EP is a winner and will definitely enhance the scope experience out on the patio..",0

What is required to hook up a DSLR to the eyepiece like this??.,0
"Just got my zoom from Agena Astro.  I ordered it Friday and it arrived Monday in NH!  Can't say enough about Manish.  Unfortunately, the cloud cover has returned, so I haven't had a chance to see if I'll have focus issues with the Powermag Wheel.  I know I'll have enough focuser travel with the larger refractors, but the Zenithstar 66SD may be a different story..",0

Just ordered mine!!!  And I found that HTA54/T2 adapter and ordered it too..,0
I've read all the comments about this eyepiece and it's behavior between 20mm and 24mm. I get the impression that the FOV widens from 20mm to 24mm but the AFOV narrows with little net effect. Is this about what happens?.,0
"Not sure, this is my first eyepiece. Just got my scope Friday..",0
The zoom's 24mm setting is nothing to write home about but still useable as a finder. I've tried comparing the view of the 20mm vs. the 24mm by counting panels on a building and the 24 shows as much and just a bit more than the 20. I've often posted before that the Hyperion zoom can just be considered as an 8-20mm zoom and it is just as great an eyepiece!.,0
"Congrats & enjoy!. Best,.",0
"I hooked my Powermag Wheel up to the Hyperion zoom and my ZenithStar 66SD and found it wouldn't reach focus, so I played around a bit and finally managed to get it to work.  I had to replace the existing OCA with a barlow element from a standard Celestron barlow.  Now the Powermag works just fine in 2x, 3x and 4x modes.  I've only been able to try this during the day because of cloudy conditions, but I am constantly amazed by the optical quality of the ZS66SD and the Powermag Wheel.  At these very high powers (probably close to 250X) distant objects are still quite sharp with no discernible CA.  Now I have try it with the larger scopes..",0
"Wow, glad to know you were able to get the zoom to work with the Powermag Wheel and the WO Zenithstar 66SD. I too am quite amazed with the WO66 and how it can take to high magnification without breaking down. It has replaced my ST80 as the favorite G&G scope and with the Hyperion zoom and 2x/3x barlows, it's the ultimate G&G setup! Looking forward to your impressions of the zoom with the bigger scopes, thanks.. Best,.",0
I have a 24mm Hyperion and I am not really impressed with its performance. Is the Baader Hyperion 8-24mm Clickstop Zoom a much better eyepiece?.,0
"What scope do you use your 24mm on? Am no fan of the zoom's 24mm, so I have an Axiom 23mm LX coming from our CN sponsor Astronomics. But it's a big EP! Maybe you should check it out, it's on limited-time sale at this point, look. The Hyperion zoom is more valuable to me more in the lower focal lengths, in the 8-16mm range.. Best,.",0
"I tested the 24mm Hyperion on an 8"" f/10 SCT. I especially did not like its performance when used with a x2 ED barlow..",0
"If 12mm is what you're after, the Hyperion 8-24mm zoom @12 will do just fine. I often use the zoom on the C8, even though I have the 9 & 12mm Naglers; and use a Televue 2x barlow or better, the zoom barlows quite well and a TV barlow makes a difference. That's how I ""see"" (pardon the pun) it.. Best,.",0
"The 24mm Hyperion is of a different optical configuration than the rest of the fixed focal length line & tends to get the least amount of positive feedback Aside from that , the Hyperion Click Stop Zoom is by far the best bang for the buck zoom eyepiece It isn't perfect , but what is ? Like Hernando said , he really doesn't like the way it performs on the 24mm setting & you must realize also that the AFOV is only about 50 degrees with the zoom on that setting as apposed to the 68 degree AFOV for the fixed focal length 24mm unit. P.S. Performance on this ocular will no doubt vary dependent on the scopes focal ratio Fast scope ? Slow scope ? Edge performance will generally be softer on the faster scopes",0
I only use between 12mm and 8mm on my zoom. That may not seem like much but with a 2.5 powermate and a 3X barlow. I can vary the power from 35X up to 235X. This gives me. quite a range on my SV-70ED refractor. This way I keep the. FOV at 65 degrees and up to 70. Not bad..,0
"I got one of these for Christmas (after many heavy-handed hints!) and I am generally impressed. It's great for grab & go and it pairs surprisingly well with my ST80 for nature study (an f5 scope!). I agree that its utility wanes a bit at 20x plus as the FOV narrows, but there are useable stops (not clicks) between 20-24. It is a bit more of a finder at 24 as the edges are a bit soft, even in my slower f7.5 Vixen. But I'll be keeping this one.",0
"I tried out my Hyperion Zoom in my 90mm Mak last night for Mars observation.  The Hyperion is great in allowing you more flexibility in magnifications in a grab-n-go setup.  The 24mm setting showed some vignetting.  I'm not sure if that is an artifact of the eyepiece itself or the result of using it in a Mak scope.  A good 1.25"" eyepiece should be able to handle 32mm focal length or so without vignetting.  But maybe the vignetting comes from necessary compromises in the design of a zoom?  In any case, I really didn't notice it in the field at night.  The low power field comes in handy when I lose sight of Mars in a non-driven scope.  Sometimes it's easier to change the setting to 24mm and relocate Mars rather than looking through the finder and repositioning the scope that way.  After the Mak cooled down fully (took about an hour), the Zoom gave relatively good views for such a small scope.  The seeing was about 3.5/5, upper 20's F, no wind.  The clicks did not seem much fainter if at all (I kept a knit cap over my ears).  I inserted the Zoom in a Parks Gold 2x Shorty Barlow for 100x-300x.  The best compromise between detail/contrast and image scale was at 12mm, giving me 200x, about 57x per inch.  I didn't bring any other eyepieces for comparison, but I'd say the Zoom gave me reasonably good views of Mars. I could easily make out the NPC and its bordering maria.  Maria near the south polar region and Hellas were visible but not as distinct as the features at the north. IMHO, the Baader Hyperion Zoom is a very good choice for a grab-n-go setup, even for planetary work.. Mike.",0
Wow! Do you hang a bowling ball off the front to balance that setup?,0
"Have to agree, as a G&G eyepiece, it can't be beat and yes, it's very good for terrestrial viewing too using my ST80 and WO66 scopes.. Best,.",0
"Mike great report, thanks!. I also do this when the object in view gets lost; also, instead of replacing the zoom with a long focal length finder EP, a simple and time-saving twist to the 24mm does the job well so in that sense the zoom24's utility as a quick finder is one of its redeeming factors.. Best,.",0
"That's going over the top; maybe an Axiom 23LX will do. Best,.",0
"Hernando,. Yes, despite criticism of the 24mm setting's relatively narrow field of view (about equal to an ortho or some Brandons) and possible vignetting (maybe because used in a Mak?), it still serves a useful purpose as a finder, or re-finder, for those who don't have goto or a driven mount.  I like it!   Mike.",0
"Mike, I couldn't agree more, it's one sweet EP! Best,.",0
"No, it doesn't balance very well at all, but it was more an exercise in seeing if it could work.  However, I have found that if you throw this setup just right, it always comes back to you.  Even without the Powermag Wheel, the eyepiece is still a bit heavy, but nothing my mount can't absorb (usually it's on a Voyager or sometimes on the LXD650).  The Hyperion zoom gives views that are just as sharp as my TMB Planetaries in the same focal length range and a somewhat wider FOV.  I'll still keep the TMBs for when I have multiple scopes set up..",0
"I notice, too, that the images in my Hyperion Zoom are about equal to those in my TMB Planetaries.  However, my Baader Genuine Ortho 9mm with a Barlow beat the Zoom and the TMBs on observations of Mars.  The Baader GO seems to have better color. Are the colors ""cooler""?  I'm not sure, but I know I like it.  Also, I seem to see detail easier with the Baader GO.  Now I wish I'd bought a shorter focal length in the GO.  At the time I wanted to fill a gap and the GO was on sale.  But the Hyperion Zoom is still great for its flexibility, the wide field at high power, great grab-n-go function, and the overall quality of the images it provides.. Mike.",0
The orthos I received from Sheldon Faworski do give a somewhat sharper image and flatter field than the Hyperion zoom but at the expense of a smaller FOV.  The flatness of field is not a huge issue and not really noticible unless I'm really looking for it. I would not part with the Faworski orthos and I'll probably buy a second Hyperion zoom for outreach programs..,0

"Mars!. Last night using my Nexstar 8 SCT, I was able to see details on Mars which this year peaked last Jan. 29 in terms of size (14.1 arc seconds) and brightness. Having the Hyperion 8-24 zoom proved to be very useful because by dialing in the right magnification for the prevailing local seeing condition for the night (for last night it was around 10mm yielding ~200x), I was able to see the bright white polar cap sticking out like a sore thumb and also the dark surface markings on the red planet. The image was small but the surface features were clearly visible during brief moments of steady seeing. Using a #21 orange-red filter that came from the Celestron EP/filter kit helped bring out and enhance the dark markings into a distinguishable form, and one just has to be patient and look intently and wait as atmospheric conditions stabilized to show more details. However the red #25 filter was too dark that it drowned out the white polar cap so I screwed back the #21 filter which was just about right in controlling the brightness of Mars on the 8"" scope. It is very exciting for me because last night and some days in the past week were the very first times that I was seeing any details on the planet but I am afraid that the Mars show will not last very long as it is now on its way to wandering off from us and will be back in 2012 but will not equal its peak appearance this year - it will only be in 2014 that it will surpass this year's size (see ). Catch the show while it lasts, this period has been very memorable for me as far as viewing Mars in its ruddy splendor is concerned. Clear skies!. (Celestron filter kit, #25 is at upper left corner; the other filters were of not much help with the red planet as much as the #21 did.). EDIT: Been informed that the Celestron #21 is actually a #23A in the Wratten filter nos.. Best,.",0
"Mars continues to put up a good show. Around the start of of this month was the best ever for me of the Mars show. That particular steady night allowed a 254x magnification (vs. 200x previously) of Mars on a freshly well collimated C8 SCT using the Hyperion zoom set at 8mm with no degradation: Syrtis Major was a constant, with sporadic clearer and more detailed views in continuous sightings. A #23A filter (#21 in my Celestron orange-red) made the Sytris jump out every now and then. The white polar cap was particularly prominent and glowing, possibly because of white clouds/dust storm within the area at that period per local astro forum. But without any filters, naked Mars was a sight to remember, with hints of texture coming in on the dark areas and the Syrtis clearly delineated in form. Continued observing Mars until it was down to 28-deg latitude and started getting fuzzy; then just watched the bright red beauty thru naked eyes. Here's my C8/Hyperion zoom Mars buster:. The bight & sunny disposition here portends another good Mars night later. Thanks and clear skies!. Best,.",0
"Iâ€™ve been mulling over this eyepiece for a year.  Based on everyoneâ€™s positive posts, I think it is time to open the wallet!  I just wish I would choose cheaper hobbies in the future at the very least I should avoid anything that involves glass",0
After lots of thought I think the Hyperion 8-24mm zoom is going to be my next EP purchase. I'm thinking about buying a TV barlow at the same time. Where is the best/cheapest place to be buying this EP?.,0
Ageana had the ceapest a month ago when I got mine. But the are sold out at the moment.  And Jason............THERE ARE NO CHEAP HOBBIES!!!,0

"I'm having a tough time deciding whether I should go with a 2X or 3X TV barlow for use in my 12"" Dob using mainly the Hyperion 8-24mm zoom (I haven't bought it yet). I had heard that magnification is limited to about 50X per square inch of aperture in reflectors so I don't want to cheat myself if I can push the 8mm to the 560X range with a 3X barlow. Obviously I won't be able to go that high very often, if at all but it would be nice to know I could if the conditions were right. Also, if I want to magnify in the 200-300X range in the 16mm and 20mm settings with a 3X barlow will I be losing quality or sacrificing FOV even more so? I only have two stock eyepieces that came with my scope, so this will be a big upgrade for me, but I want to do it right!.",0
I use a 2x barlow a 2.5X Powermate and a 3X barlow with my Zoom. I can stack these in any way I want for about any power I want..,0
"It's just natural that we want to get the most magnification from the scopes that we have, the 50x/in-aperture is not set in stone though, a lot will depend on the seeing conditions where the scope is used, but generally the most useful higher magnifications are in the 200 to 300x, going over that can yield a bigger image but with no appreciable increase in details and may even be blurry if the atmospheric conditions are less than stellar. Like last night was another good Mars night for me again (taking advantage while Mars is still near although it's wandering off away from us now) and I was able to get a clear view at 254x with my 8"" SCT using the 8mm setting of the Hyperion zoom. Then I tried using my other EPs in successive progression going for shorter focal lengths than the 8mm of the zoom - a 7mm Meade Research Grade ortho, a 6mm Baader Genuine Ortho, then the 5mm Nagler T6 and the power was just too much to make out any additional details and the planet also became blurry (technically, following the 50x/in. rule, my 8"" should handle 400x but it didn't) so I just reverted back to 8mm with the zoom which gave me very clear views of Mars' Syrtis Major, the bright white polar cap and the dark surrounding areas encircling it.. If you take a look at the 12"" Dob site and specs sheet in , you will notice that it is indicated that the ""hightest useful magnification"" for this scope is 300x, with the note:. So back to the barlow question - 2x or 3x with the Hyperion zoom? If your scope is an apo refractor which can take in more magnification per inch than mirror-type scopes with central obstructions like your Dob or SCT's, I would go for the 3x. But for your reflector scope, I'm leaning towards the 2x barlow (will give you 375x max. in your scope). You've made a very good point about limiting the FOV with a 3x - when it comes to this point, it is always best to barlow as close to 8mm to get the maximum field of view possible; the farther away from 8mm, the smaller the fov becomes. And also, you have to consider the physical aspects of the barlows - the 3x is longer than the 2x barlow so it becomes quite unwieldy using the 3x:. The entire thing seems bigger than the small refractor scope!  That's why the TV 2x is my favorite barlow to use for the zoom (and 2x may also be the most popular barlow), but Phil's recommendation about a Powermate 2.5x is also good, in fact, I have one coming - it's a nice compromise between 2x and 3x, so that's another option that you can go for, a TV 2.5x barlow - oh choices, choices, there's always so many of them to make and it can be hard at times to make a decision, but it's quite a ride really and that's part and parcel of the game, the important thing is that you're enjoying yourself in this unique and wonderful hobby of ours. Hope this helps.. Best,.",0
Thank you for going into so much detail! I think I'm sold on the TV 2X Barlow and the Hyperion 8-24mm Zoom. Thanks again for everyone's input..,0
"Now my turn to ask. I have a Powermate 2.5 and a Celestron 2x barlow (Achro). Powermate is better than any Barlow but I like powering my zoom (and other EPs) at 1.5 by screwing the barlow's font lens directly to the EP. This way I go down to 5.3mm which is almost my Nexstar's Limit without loosing FOV from the zoom.. Should I buy a Televue 2x Barlow instead of the Celestron just for that cause? I've spend a lot lately and two Hyperions (31 & 17) are waiting, but I feel I might have better results with the TV. I suppose I could also try the front lens of one of my Hyperions, but I do not have the 21mm and I do not know how much power the others can give me..",0
You know I thought about screwing the 2X barlow lens onto. the front of the Zoom for about 1.5X then using the 2.5X. Powermate. That would give me 140X on the 12mm setting and. 195X on the 8mm setting. I use a SV-70mmED..,0
"Have also tried what you did by removing the nosepiece from my Celestron Omni 2x barlow and screwing it onto the Hyperion zoom:. I wanted to do the same thing using the one that came off my TV 2x barlow:. But unfortunately, the TV barlow nosepiece thread is different and does not mesh with the zoom like the one from the Celestron 2x barlow.. With respect to using the nosepiece of a fixed focal lenth Hyperion with the zoom, one poster (post #3263398) from the  estimated the following resultant effect:. 8mm -> 2.6 - 8mm Zoom. 13mm -> 4-12mm Zoom 17mm -> a 5.5-16mm Zoom. while others say that the nosepiece from the 21mm yields 4-12mm too. These are all just eye-ball estimates with no imprimatur from Baader. So, using the nosepiece from your coming Hyperion 17mm should do the trick regarding what you are after in converting the zoom to yield around ~5.5mm. Hope this helps. Best,.",0
"Hernado, you saved me a wrong acquisition.. I already have 8mm and 13mm, with 17mm on its way. I have also 24mm (with no Smythe group) so I am not going to have 21, but with these 3 (8, 13, 17) I might have the following:. Smythe 17mm 5.5-16Zoom1,5x. Smythe 13mm4-12Zoom2x. Powermate 3.2-9.6Zoom2.5x. Smythe 8mm2.6 - 8Zoom3x. So 21mm is not really needed, because it gives the same as 13mm. I also do not need its 2â€™â€™ 32mm focal length, because together with the 17mm comes an Aspheric 31mm.. So thatâ€™s all. The only thing that remains is to use it and see if there is any viewable degradation with these Smythe lenses.. Until now I used a lot an Astrocom Focal Reducer and my Celestrons Barlow frontal lens and I can say I was happy, especially with the reducer which opens the FOV for the 16-24mm settings.. I believe the only thing that could be better (in theory at least) for use with the Hyperion zoom, would be a Denk or a Siebert Power Wheel.. When doing a hobby for leisure and fun, to retire after hard work, you have the absolute right to be lazy..",0
"Glad to be of help. It's good to know that you practically have the whole Hyperion entourage, congrats, the Hyperions are great value eyepieces and were even selected among Sky & Telescope Hot Products for the year when they were introduced. And the 17mm that you have coming is said to be the best of the whole lot. Do let us know how the different nosepieces work out with the zoom for you.. The Denk and Siebert Power Wheel are good products if we are to go with forum posts and reviews about them. I don't doubt it with regards to the Power Wheel - Harry Siebert churns out very good products, I have some of his EPs, they're sharp cookies, never mind that they have the rather spartan and industrial look, there is after all, elegance in simplicity too.. Well said, I can relate to that, thanks!. Best,.",0
"It is cloudy here, so I tried indoors several combinations. The frontal lens of both my 13 & 8 screwed smoothly on my zoom.. Now I wonder about exchanging lenses between 17, 13 & 8, or putting the lenses to 31 & 24, which have no barlow element. Probably they would be barlowed, but I wonder how much and if they would be properly corrected. This could also make the use of Fine Tune Rings feasible to Zoom, 31mm and 24mm too!. Oh mine! The possibilities are endless. It is a bit distracting from our central aim of stargazing, but with the weather here, all I can do is experimenting.. I wish I had a modus of calculating the magnifications in the daytime. I know how to do it with a grid of known dimensions far away, but there isn't any around here.... There are better eyepieces than Baaders out there but that multiform concept of the Germans is unique and quite appealing to me. Hyperions are not just eyepieces, they are true gadgets to play with. And I am here to play. Enough with brain science from 9:00 to 22:00 hours everyday 15 years now. At night and vacation science becomes a game and game becomes a science..",0
"So I continue to be thankful of being gifted with clear skies tonight, and be with the mistress of the night - the resplendent red beauty, Mars, now shining still brightly at -1.1 magnitude and 13.9 arcsec. in diameter. With the C8/Zoom @8mm/orange-red #23A (Wratten) filter, magnification of 254x, after crossing the meridian and viewed at around 40-deg latitude, Mars again displays its rich albedo (dark areas) features, the prominent Syrtis Major a constant, with good contrast, jutting out from a dark base strip with an outlined bald area below it. At the opposite end can be observed the bright white northern polar cap which is engulfed in a dark ring with a distinguishable protrusion toward the Syrtis side. The Mars disc is clearly defined with a sharp edge..  Decided to do an experiment to compare the difference if any and how big a difference, of viewing Mars with or without a barlow - i.e., compare the Hyperion zoom @ 8mm and the zoom @16mm with a TV 2x barlow (to yield the equivalent 8mm power without barlow). Result: with the barlow, Syrtis is not a constant anymore, have to wait for steady seeing for it to become apparent; the white polar cap appears weak than without barlow and a general reduction of sharpness throughout, including the outline of the disk which is now soft as compared to no barlow. Conclusion: Even a good barlow has a visually measurable effect when used with the zoom and that unbarlowed is still the best way to use the Hyperion zoom, there's nothing like the unadulterated zoom sans barlow, the additional glass does affect sharpness and crispness of the view, at least for Mars in this case. Next: the Powermate 2.5x when I take receipt of it. Just sharing/reporting..  Best,.",0
"Great permutations that you're considering! Pls let us know the results, it is of much interest to find out. With my 2nd generation zoom, I am not able to securely screw on the nosepiece of the fixed 21mm Hyperion that I have, it only plugs in and the attachment is not so secure:. Glad you're having fun tinkering around with your Hyperions, it sure is an antidote to keep busy during cloudy nights. Do keep us posted when the skies clear up there and you are able to proceed in testing the different combinations/permutations, thanks. Clear skies!. Best,.",0
Here is my little scope with the 2.5 Powermate and the Zoom.. Not really that too tall of a tower..,0
"Phil, thanks for posting! That sure looks doable; nice setup!. Best,.",0
"I would venture to say Hernando, that if you used the Zoom. and the 2.5 Powermate, your view on Mars would be as good. or a little better than the ""No barlow"" view. It's that good!.",0
"After viewing Mars and before wrapping up and calling it the night, noticed that Alpha Centauri, just to the left of the Southern Cross, was at it's higher max. position (14-deg lat.) in the sky, so I initiated a GOTO and zoomed in on the system, the binary was split; put on the TV 2x barlow @8mm zoom to yeild a ~500x power and what do you know, it works! The split was more prominent and was much wider than at the zoom's unbarlowed 8mm, it was beautiful to watch! (A third component of this system, Proxima, is the nearest star to us after the Sun, but is too frail to be visible.) This is an instance where the barlow proved extremely useful, so the barlow does have its place depending on the object being viewed. The same goes when looking at the moon, high magnifications are possible with not too much degradation and still quite palatable. I think Phil can attest to this. The barlows will stay as companions to the Hyperion zoom, it can prove very useful.. Best,.",0
"Phil, that remains to be seen, and I'm betting you may be right! Can't wait to try it out (but it will take some time - have to contend with slow overseas shipping). Thanks.. Best,.",0
"Hernando, I don't put the Smythe group the way you do. Noticing that it screws to a 2'' barrel,the way the filters do, I concluded that it can be screwed to any 2'' barrel that accepts filters! Hyperion zoom is gifted with such a barrel, so I put the 2'' barrel and then screw on it any Smythe element. Piece of cake! I believe you can do the same thing, no matter the generation of your zoom, if you have the alternative 2'' nose piece.. In fact you should be able to put the 21's nosepiece to your Siebert and any other 2'' EP. It is threaded as any regular standard 2'' filter.. Try it.. Look at the picture. I thought it was your 21 & zoom..",0
"Konstantinos thanks; no, the pic you posted is not my zoom & 21 but from someone else; lets take it from the top. Here's my zoom & 21 ready for swapping parts - I have unscrewed the nosepiece from the 21 and also the 1-1/4"" sleeve from the zoom, with the 2"" sleeve beside it (Pic 1):. Next, the nosepiece from the 21 is transferred to the zoom, and there is nothing to screw it on (Pic 2):. Since there is no groove to screw it on, the 21nosepiece is just ""plugged"" onto the nose of the zoom (Pic 3):. The knurled lock ring of the zoom is then removed, and its 2"" sleeve is screwed on (Pic 4):. Pls tell me what I'm missing here, how do you do it with yours? Thanks.. Best,.",0
"Phil, just got an idea :hmmmm: - can you do us the favor of doing your amazing dollar bill markings tests on the Hyperion Zoom's 8mm ""Barlow"" using the Powermate 2.5x and ""No barlow"" and posting the pics? (That would be zoom @ 20mm+PM 2.5x, and barebones zoom @ 8mm.) Thanks!. Best,.",0
"Well, as I see our zooms are not different at all, but your 21 might be different from my 13 & 8mm. You see, I unscrew the frontal element together with that black ring (you can see it in the blue circle. That ring then is screwed to the filter thread of the 2'' nosepiece of the Zoom (look the former picture). It is VERY sturdy that way!. Look at your 21mm. Can you unscrew the black ring together with the chrome barrel? Now I look it, the 21mm ring is smaller then the zoom ring! That's why you can't do it. Probably that has to do with the smaller field stop the 21 mm has. 21mm is the only Hyperion that gives a 2'' 32mm occular, all the others give around 22mm when you remove the frontal lens.. So, now I understand that you can't use the 21mm's frontal lens the way I do, but you can use all the others, positively for 13 & 8 & 24mm (although 24mm has no lens in the housing) and maybe 17mm (I will try in a few days) and the shorter ones (5mm and 3.5mm).. That's it Hernando! Conclusion: The 21mm has a field stop in the 2'' barrel rim, so the black ring is made to fit the field stop and it is not screwable to the zoom's 2'' barrel. Other Hyperions do not have this field stop. 21mm is different than any other Hyperion because it is the only 32mm without the Smythe group (all the others around 22mm), it is the taller one (all the others are progresively taller, starting with 24mm no-barlow and going to 3.5mm) and it is the only one with AFOV 60 degrees (probably because of the field stop, all the others 68 degrees).. So you'll be having to enrich your collection with another fixed focal Hyperion in order to try this setup. I hear that 17mm is the best and you can transform it to 13.1mm, 10.8mm and 9.2mm with 2 cheap fine tune rings, so you could go for that. It's frontal lens gives (you said so) 1.5x to the zoom which is the limit to using it with your SCT, retaining the great AFOV of 8mm setting.. Hernando, I am probably the second most excited Hyperion zoom fan in the Universe, cause there is no doubt, you are the No 1!",0
"Konstantinos thanks!!! Following your suggestion, I fiddled around with the Hyperion 21mm's nosepiece, almost gave up as only the chrome piece was screwing out but after much persistence I finally was able to remove the black ring together with the chrome nosepiece!  And just like that, I was able to proceed to screw the unit onto the 2"" sleeve of the zoom which indeed is now very securely set:. Am feeling like I have a totally new eyepiece/zoom!  Can't help but luv this Hyperion modular design, it's quite a clever and sleek innovation. Will try it out later on Mars when the planet comes into view. Thanks again! Best,.",0
"Laughed out loud when I read your closing remarks, but really, I'm uber glad to come across and get to know of another Hyperion zoom die-hard fan! BTW, I'm planning to go to Greece sometime this year for a visit as a treat for the wife.. Best,.",0
"Glad I could help. Hyperions are true gadgets, toys for boys! And they give excellent views too, at least to SCT users. For the money of an 21 Ethos I would lust for if I had a f5 Dob, I am going to have a Hyperion zoom and 5 of his brothers.. When I finish my ''Hyperion project'' next month, I think I'll gather 1-2 Genuine Orthos and put them in my case by their siblings, in order to honor Baader. Even if UO's are the same and cheaper, I am in fond of the Baader and I want to read their name in the majority of my EP's. And all that started with the zoom..",0
"Geia sou kkokkolis,. I have the Baader Genunie Orthoscopic 9mm.  It gives me the best view of Mars in my scopes.  Nice neutral color and shows more detail than my other eyepieces.  Now I wish I'd gotten a shorter focal length for my Newts.. But the Hyperion Zoom isn't bad!. Mike. Now back to the thread....",0
"OK, Hernando, Here is what you asked for and more. This is. from about 30 ft away. First Test.",0
Second Test.,0
Third Test.,0
Is it me or are the leafs at the botton of the picture are clearer with the 22 pan barlowed than with the zoom??.,0
I agree. Just look at the details in the wig..,0
The image with the Pan is clearly much sharper. The Baader looks like it's not focused...,0
"The Hyperion zoom is also among my very first EPs after getting the Celestron EP/filter kit and I have not stopped liking it since day 1 that I received it. Many many EPs later, it remains as my favorite #1 EP; and being a gadget lover myself, the zoom is quite a number - you're right, there are so many neat and cool things that you can do with it or that it does - as a whole it embodies the collective fascination one can have with say, a full packed Swiss knife - it is a can do eyepiece in more ways than one.. As for it's cousin, the Baader Genuine Ortho, I have the 6mm:. Very sharp, like Mike said, but for my C8, the BGO 6 was doing too much power; will compare it later with the Zoom @12mm & 2x of the 21mm nosepiece using a WO 102ED refractor. I think the ""Phantom"" coatings which are among the latest technology today has much to do with the excellent light transmission of the Hyperion zoom/BGO's, giving bright, crisp, contrasty views that make for so many happy campers today. Keep the faith, I know I will for sure.. Best,.",0
"Phil thanks a lot! Your pics are as always, stunning!  I've been staring at the three for quite some time (much like what I'd do with the planets) and I will have to agree with FranÃ§ois, Jimmy, and Noah_way - the Panoptic pic is clearer/sharper but it may be that @22/2.5x, it is yielding the equivalent of an 8.8mm EP as compared to the zoom's 8mm pic and as is expected, the lower magnification can produce a sharper image, but nevertheless, if adjusted I think the Pan will still come out looking good - I have one myself, a Pan27 which is my favorite among the longer FL 2"" EPs that I have.. Anyway, going back to the ""Barlow""/""No barlow"" comparison, I am looking at the dark shadings below the eye on the right side - the Zoom 8mm's image seems more detailed than the 20mm/2.5x combo such that the unbarlowed zoom does look as if it is a bit sharper - what do you think? Thanks.. Best,.",0
"Was able to get to Mars last night, but it was already down to around 30-deg. alt. and the atmosphere was a bit hazy so the seeing wasn't so good that I had to move down to the 12mm setting of the zoom (the ability to adjust up or down using the variable focal lengths of Hyperion zoom is one of the big plus of this EP with respect to dialing just the right magnification on any give night) at 169x magnification on the C8 to get the best crispiest results. Fortunately, Saturn was up, and at around 50ish-deg latitude it made for a better target. To make the comparison, I concentrated on 3 prominent features, namely: #1 - the dark space between the planet and the inner belt, #2 - the apparently thick belt system that was visible at the given magnification and #3 - the ring traversing the planet which being a bit edge on was just a seeming line across the plane. With the zoom @ 12mm setting, Saturn looked majestic and #1, #2 and #3 were constants. At 24mm with the TV 2x barlow, #3 was constant but both #1 & #2 were blinking in and out of vision, while the zoom @ 24mm using the 21nosepiece produced just as good (if not a tad better) as the results with the TV 2x barlow. Ergonomically, the 21nosepiece wins hands down such that it may now be my barlow of choice with the Hyperion zoom in my future observations. Will conduct further comparisons when the seeing allows.. Best,.",0
"The 20- powermate combination looks very bright. It shouldn't be! It should be the same or dimmer than the 8mm (because of 4 more lenses). The details are washed out. So you can't compare that photo with the others.. Other than that, knowing that we should compare Hyperion zoom with Televue zoom and 22 Panoptic with 21 Hyperion, I must say that Panoptic should be better for the money it costs and being a fixed FL, but Hyperion is not bad at all (at 8mm at least) and considering its versatility and lower cost, for me it is an overall winner..",0
Wooohoooo!!!! Just got my 8-24 Zoom in yesterday. Hopefully the weather will cooperate this weekend for a little viewing,0
"Congrats! Welcome to the club; do let us know how it goes, enjoy!. Best,.",0
"It's all clouded out tonight!  No Mars, no Saturn, so it's back to reading CN forum posts for me, oh well... Best,.",0
"I'm not sure I understand why this would be so.  Can you explain why the higher magnification wouldn't produce as sharp an image when indoors and only 30 feet away?  I can see why higher mags might not be as sharp under the night sky when affected by seeing conditions and astronomical distances, but shouldn't higher magnifications be just as sharp, and reveal more details under this ""controlled"" condition?. This is quite the thread on the Baader zoom.  The photos really caught my eye.  It looks like you're definitely losing something with the zoom (when compared to a top of the line fixed fl ep anyway)..",0
"It's not quite what it seems; I own Naglers and Panoptic too, and know that the Hyperion zoom does not give up much to good fixed focal length EPs as the pics might suggest; and you don't have to take my word for it, try it out when you get the chance to, and here are some quotes from the veteran AAs and may we say hard-core astro-observers about the Hyperion zoom:. Jrbarnett:. To make a long story short, I was utterly, completely, blown away. Fantastic eyepiece and far sharper on axis and off than the fixed focal length Hyperions. I have no idea how Baader pulled this off, but the Hyperion Zoom is an excellent eyepiece competing favorably with quality fixed focal length units.. BillP:. Agree. My Zoom was as good or bested my various fixed Hyperions. Jrbarnett:. Likewise, I've been thoroughly underwhelmed by Leica Zooms, Televue and Vixen 8-24 Zooms, Pentax XL Zooms, etc. The 8-24mm Hyperion Zoom was besting my TMB Supermonos and Pentax SMC Orthos on Jupiter's bands... Cuzimthedad:..Hyperion zoom..and I have to say this is quite an incredible eyepiece. I observed a couple of double stars, the double cluster and M31 and was very impressed with it's performance both optically and mechanically; so much so that I may have to add one to my stable of Naglers. Rick Socarras:. The Hyperion is simply a far more superior zoom eyepiece in almost every respect.. What do I have to compare it against? I have all the Televue Ethos and all the TV zooms (3 of them for now). I have most TV Naglers and Plossls. I have ALL the TMB supermonos. The Hyperion zoom is not that far behind the best of these eyepieces that I own.. TimA:. There seems to be a consensus around the Baader Hyperion 8-24mm zoom. I understand why; I have one, and it's an amazing performer, very much the equal in many instances to single FL EP. Highly recommended! And many more!. Reference theads: ,  , and. Best,.",0
"Oh I was in no way disputing that it's a decent eyepiece, especially for the price.  Sorry if I gave that impression.  I've not looked through one, and was merely commenting on the photos.  I know it's difficult to take photos like the ones posted, but you have to admit, going by the photos (Just comparing the 8mm un-barlowed zoom to the barlowed Panoptic), the difference in sharpness is rather stark.  I'm sure under the night sky that difference wouldn't be as apparent..",0
"Well taken really; yup that's right, even I threw in my comment that the 3rd pic is indeed the sharpest among the pics posted, but hand-held shots from above the eyepiece hardly qualify for a controlled condition or environment (see comments of Noah_way and Kkokkolis about the pics) from which we can derive definitive performance conclusions - we just take it at its face value (pardon the pun)..

"I will say this, I compared the Zoom with barlow at 130X. compared to a TMB 3.2 and a 3.5 Hyperion. Ihe view was not. near as good as the Zoom. So they were sold. My photo test. are with a hand held camera, so there can be some shake.. What I do is take 10 pictures of a given eyepiece and pick. the best one of the 10, then take another 10 with another. combinition and do the same.

"Phil,. So the Hyperion Zoom with/barlow was better than a TMB 3.2 or a 3.5 Hyperion?  Cool!  What was the barlow?  The 2.5 Powermate?. Mike.",0
"Yes it was, I used the Zoom on 8mm with the 2.5 Powermate. for 130X. The 3.5 Hyperion was a lot harder to get into focus, and the imiage was not as near clear and sharp. The. TMB was worst than the Hyperion. Looked like it has a ""flim"". over the lens. The imiage in the Zoom really is a lot better. than the pictures show. I used the Orion 3X Tri-Mag barlow. with excellcent results. On 8mm, power is 155X. This is in. a Stellarvue SV-70ED refracter scope with a 420 FL.",0
"The only eyepiece I have which has given more detail and better color on Mars has been my Baader Genuine Ortho 9mm.

I used the Hyperion Zoom with the same barlows and it was still very good, had a larger AFOV, and, of course, you could dial in the best magnification for the current seeing.. Mike.",0

"My observation in that Hayneedle's ship dates are a rolling date, usually about 3 weeks out from today's date. I think this happens on all ""out of stock"" items. I do not think it is based on manufacturer delivery times. When the item arrives, the 3-week estimated ship date disappears and the item becomes available.. If you check the estimated date for the Hyperion Zoom tomorrow, it will probably be one day later than today..",0
"Hayneedle says they are available in a very loose sense as in that they are available somewhere in the world at some future time not that they have the eyepiece in stock.. Ordered it as available,  email-1 confirmation with a few minutes.

"Baader should really step up production of the Hyperion zooms for supply to the US markets - it has captured the imagination of enthusiasts and is a real boon to beginners who started out with just stock eyepieces that came with the new scope to begin with like these:. Getting the HypZoom is a perceptible and apparent step-up from the stock EPs and the good thing about having the zoom is that one will not feel left wanting and wondering later on if a lesser EP was obtained, on how a world-class EP performs because the HypZoom has got what it takes to be one.

"Obviously not, and don't see any reason to do so. Assuming that the Hyperion zooms are manufactured there (which Manfred says they're not) and they want to forgo all the profits from selling truckloads of Hyperion zooms in the US, so be it - it's their loss! Best,.",0

And how can a country that small can export way more goods than import? By relaxing and looking out of the window? As Manfred said, the Hyperions are not made in Germany but in Japan or China. And almost no other eyepiece SOLD by German firms is MANUFACTURED here. My Leica zoom definitely is but I know of no other - the ZAOIIs are not made any more.. Andreas.",0
"Good question! Sure would like to know too; hope Andreas drops by to tell us.  But if I were to make a wild guess, wouldn't right away assume as others would, that they're manufactured wholly in G. The excellent price point of the Hyperion zoom @ around $200 would probably preclude complete manufacturing there - the retail price too low for that, possibly then, an incognito plant in China, just an imaginative conjecture.

"The Mars saga continues, quite the ""star"" these days as it recedes from its peak at opposition. Last night viewing was not so good so I zoomed down to 12mm with the C8 (169x), this time using an Orion Skyglow filter which I read from a recent thread was used to good results for viewing Mars:. Result: The white polar cap was visible but the dark albedo features were just slight, well maybe because the boring side of Mars was upon us this time, but even then I did not like the filter much on Mars, it made the planet look like Uranus color-wise.  I'll stick to the Celestron #21 orange-red (23A Wratten) filter. Best,.",0
"And because Mars is putting up a good show these days, there have been inquiries as to what EP will be good to use with the red planet, so I suggested the Hyperion zoom, several agreed:. My response:. So true, the best magnification also changes within the night, so for example, on a not so good night, I find the sharpest on Mars is 12mm setting on the zoom; after a while, atmospheric conditions improve a bit, and with a twist, I am able to adjust right away to 10mm yielding ~200x and viola, a bigger disc at its sharpest. You have to go after and catch the moment really and the zoom excels on this requirement for good Mars viewing. Versatility has always been a strong point of the zoom EPs, but none in its price class has come to this impressive state-of-the-art performance, that it has changed completely the zoom landscape, from pariah to the best-bang-for-buck EP.

"Interesting thread about how a Hyperion zoom @8mm + TV 2x barlow + Proxima 1.5x barlow stack on a TV 85 refractor was giving a sharper image of Mars than the top rated Pentax XO 2.5mm:. But I can imagine how tall those double stacked barlows would have looked like, more like the Tower of Babel I suppose. Last night, in between passing clouds, Mars, now just -0.8 magnitude and 12.8 arcsec in size, was available for viewing so this time, I brought out the WO Megrez 102ED F/7 scope and boarded up the Hyperion zoom with the 21mm nosepiece for a more compact setup than the tall TV 2x barlow:. Zoomed in to 8mm setting, effectively yielding a 4mm EP or 178x on the 102mm refractor and Mars looked sharp with the white northern polar cap still prominent and some dark features to one side of the cap and also at the opposite limb area. Using the TV 2x barlow on the zoom w/21mm nosepiece increased image size but with no further details revealed. Next, removed the 21mm nosepiece and reverted back to the zoom's default setup and barlowed using the TV 2x for comparison with the nosepiece mode - the views were about the same in terms of contrast and details reaffirming initial findings that the nosepiece barlow is just as good as the TV 2x barlow on the zoom, but a lot better ergonomically because of the compact set up. Next stop, will try comparing the two later tonight using the Moon as target weather permitting.. Best,.",0
"With the first quarter Moon available for viewing tonight, one of the more fascinating feature to observe in Mare Nubium is the lunar fault Straight Wall (or the Railroad), around 120 kilometers long, which is also likened to the blade of a sword terminating in a group of mountains which seemingly is the handle of the sword:. Running almost parallel to it is a faint crack, a rille called the Rima Brit which is just off to the left of the bright crater Brit in the pic above. At 178x on the 4"" ED refractor, this feature is quite a challenge to see and thus useful to compare the 21mm nosepiece barlow vs. the TV 2x barlow on the Hyperion zoom set at 8mm. Swapping back and forth between the two, the Rima Brit is barely visible with the TV 2x barlow and appeared cut off at times near crater Brit, but the rille is just a bit more pronounced on the 21mm nosepiece barlow and appeared like a complete line in most instances, thus further supporting the observation that the 21mm NP barlow has the slight edge vs. the TV 2x barlow when used with the Hyperion zoom..

FYI - telescopes.com said they are expecting to receive the zooms on 4/12/10 - not a confirmed date yet - an estimate.. I am still considering cancelling my order and getting the Meade 5000 SWAs and a Televue Powermate instead..,0
"Rob, since this is the Hyperion zoom thread, I won't mince words about my recommendation for the Hyperion zoom; this is THE plan: Get the Hyperion zoom first, at one end is to determine your max. magnification (barlow may be needed) for the scope given the seeing conditions at your site, then to find a favorite FL - play around with the magnifications given on your scope, to see which one you use and enjoy most, (something you can never do with any fixed focal length units) then get a Meade UWA or ES 82-deg. for that focal length. Even if eventually you replace all the focal settings on the zoom with a wider field (but the HypZoom's 72-deg. 8mm drift tested (68 published) is already an eyefull. Even the vaunted Pentax XW's with a cult-like following are only 70-degree'ers. Some observers like it this way, the object is nicely framed, and one does not have to move the eye/head about to see the field stop, which to some is distracting. So with the zoom, you have the potential of a good grab & go EP, as one poster here in the forums say (I think he'll barge in anytime soon) that even if one has 50 eyepieces, the Hyperion zoom will always be a welcome addition. Pls don't cancel your order for one, just want the best for you. Again, just 2 cents.. Best,.",0
"Since the subject of telescopes.com has always been coming up, let me share my experience with them. This should be taken as an individual case, not in any way indicative of anything else. There was a time when the Vixen LVW wide Lanthanium EP's went on sale and the prices were very good, something like $130 for a 22mm - excellent deal right? So I ordered one, and just like right now with the Hyperion zoom, they were on back order. To make the long story short, they did not deliver, they eventually canceled my order because of a mix-up, don't really know, but it left a bad taste; but I didn't give up right away on them, ordered other items, this time a Skyscout and a Connect, to link up with the Nexstar. While the Skyscout was brand new, the Connect was obviously not new, which they acknowledged, good it was working. As you might have surmised, that was the last. Now, I always look first to our CN sponsor, Astronomics for my astro needs, only when they're out of stock do I resort to other reliable vendors.. So won't exactly bet the house on that April 12 ""estimate"" date, its redeeming aspect is it's now being on the same month as other vendors' estimate date are, not earlier.. Just sharing, thanks..

"I was totally loving the zoom until I did an inspection in the daytime and discovered either a small bent eyelash piece or a fly leg trapped in between the lenses. Couldn't see it at night for my first week of viewing after I bought it. I had it sent back to be cleaned or replaced. I was told it should be back in about a week or so. I miss it already. the zoom is going to keep my eyepiece collection low. I am stopping eyepiece purchases after a 7mm Axiom, a 36 Baader aspheric, and a Siebert 2"" 2.5x Telecentric Barlow. 4 eyepieces including the zoom, 2"" 2x and 2"" 2.5x barlows, 2"" filters (barlows are both threaded) and it keeps me down to 6 pieces and a huge array of focal lengths. I don't have to use the longer focal lengths on the zoom (even though they still give a fantastic view)and I essentially get a pretty wide FOV on everything too. Keeps me at 2"" for everything but the 7mm too with those nice 2"" adapters on the Baaders. I love the weight of it too. I hope they hurry with the cleaning..",0

"A little late to chime back in, but I just saw the response.. I certainly wasn't bashing the Germans - sorry if it came off that way.  I love the German people dearly and the country is fantastic.. I deal with a dozen or so German manufacturers on a very regular basis (namely the 'sophisticated machinery' you refer to) and have spent quite a lot of my time in Germany.  The end product is always great; however it is always with much frustration and schedule slipping to get to that point - even with a 'standard' machine that they have produced time & time again.  It is my personal experience that it is next to impossible to expedite their process - even the pouring of a beer takes seemingly forever, but I've learned to order another when I am still half full.. I admit to have wrongly assumed that Baader actually manufactured their own eyepieces; hopefully this is not a 100% manufacture and they have some important piece in the production process..",0

Changing gears here.........I have this same set up now and it seems to be blurring the image when the shutter trips. Is there anything to do to correct it?? It seems there is alot hanging out there..,0
"Have you tried the remote shutter?. That should eliminate/reduce the ""shake."". Best,.",0
"Some EOS models have mirror lockup where you can flip the mirror prior to shutter release.  The movement of the mirror causes the majority of the vibration when you take a picture.  Also if you do not have a remote shutter release use a time delay of 5-10 seconds.  Making sure your tube is properly balanced helps too.. Edit:  I now see you have a Nikon D90 - these do not have the Mirror Lockup function, but if you use the Exposure Delay, I believe the mirror flips up about 1s before the shutter is released - that should help some..",0

Don't worry. It's ok. I'm sorry for your bad experiences but I don't think them to be typical..  You are right. There is an ineradicable myth that pouring a good beer should take seven minutes. This is of course nonsense because the beer will be dead.. Andreas.,0
"Been to Germany once (Cologne, Rhineland, Heidelberg, Black Forrest), and I luv the beer! (Couldn't sample all though, there were simply too many. )..  Best,",0
"Yes I was using a remote (wireless) trigger. It is very obvious you can hear the mirror flip up as the shutter is triggered. When you have it on live view the mirror is flipped up but when you trigger it it sounds like the mirror actually does a double take.......flips down then back up, then triggers the shutter.. Now it does have a mirror lock-up that it says for cleaning, not sure if it will take a picture with it up or not.. I just thought of something else, I didn't have the VR (vibration reduction) turned on either. That would probably help reduce some of it..",0
"From what I know about the D90 - which isn't a whole bunch - you won't be able to take a photo in the mirror lockup (cleaning mode).  In addition to the vibration reduction & remote trigger, use a 5-10s exposure time delay function and the mirror should lock up a second or two prior to the shutter release.. Strange what you say about the Live View mode - something squirrely is going on with that from the sound of it..",0
"I bought stuff from US (Optcorp). Why don't you buy Hyperion zoom from Europe? There are plenty of Hyperions here, I had mine the same day I asked for it.. ,8628. Use google translate and go for it. Hyperions are the only Astrogadget that is cheaper in Greece than in the rest of the world. Usually we pay up to double the price here..",0
"Not too bad of a price ~$235US, but I think the shipping would be expensive, not to mention if they made us pay duty as well.  I'll be somewhere in Europe next month, I might take a look at the store prices while I am there..",0
"I can't believe I haven't seen this thread until today.  I bought the 8-24 zoom a couple years ago and love it.  It's my go-to eyepiece for my grab-n-go Orion ShortTube80.  Over the holidays I brought a collection of my eyepieces with me on a family visit where I tested them in the Orion 90mm Mak that I bought for my nephew a couple years ago.  Out of many eyepieces I tested with it, the Hyperion 8-24 zoom blew them away.  I gave the eyepiece to my nephew, and said I'd order myself another one.  (My brother said he'd pay for it.)  -I just got around to ordering it last week.  I ordered from OPT, (they give a 5% discount to CN members) and they had a backorder of nine orders, with one in stock.  I went ahead and preordered it, but have no idea when it will be back in stock.  I really miss the eyepiece.  It's a good thing we've had lots of rain or I'd be missing it even more.  I also use it with my Orion 150mm Mak, and really like it for splitting double stars, as it makes it simple to tell what magnification the split occurs.   Absolutely my favorite eyepiece.. -Mark.",0

"One other thing to keep in mind with the D90 (somewhat unrelated). I visited Costa Rica for the third time a few years back and a good friend brought his brand new D70 with him (we had plans and rudimentary tools for attempting astrophotography, but the rainy season skies had other ideas). He did get some great shots of Mt. Arenal at night, but he had a few Rums in him and couldn't be bothered to fetch and hook up the cable release. The wireless remote worked fine, but several shots were marred by the pink IR dots and flashes from the remote. He didn't believe me until we saw the final shots...he got some great ones regardless, but learned his lesson.",0

There are times I wish I had something in the trunk with a little more firepower, but 90% of the time it's all I need...and my back appreciates it.. Now all I need is recommendation for a better 1.25"" 45 degree prism diagonal for the daytime...",0
"I must be the only one who isn't impressed with the hyperion zoom. I find mine to be not real contrasty, very touchy to focus and only sharp to about 80% even at 8mm in my f/4.7. At the lower focal length's, the FOV is too small to use effectively as a finder, except for really easy objects. Those are my initial impressions. I've used it 3 times so far so the jury is still out, but it hasn't blown me away yet. I like the idea of a zoom becauase I don't like changing EP's all the time, espescially in the cold but so far I'm finding my meade 5K's and my stratus are giving me more pleasing views..",0
Sacrilege!!!  Now you've done it.  This thread will be good for another four or five pages at least.,0
"Spaceoddity, when I first looked through my Hyperion zoom and was wowed by the view I saw, one of the very first things that made an impact on me is the really contrasty and excellent light transmission rendition of the zoom; and the focusing was no problem at all.. Maybe you should take a page from one of the more respected members of the forum, Jrbarnett, who said:. There have been a few reports of QA issues with the zoom and it just might be that the zoom you received is a sample that's not up to snuff. And I too have a Meade UWA Series 5000:. The Hyperion zoom is every bit as sharp and contrasty as the Meade, if not more; one thing that bothers me with the Meade UWA is the finicky eye positioning which is prone to kidney beaning, something which is alien to the Hyperion zoom - absolutely no kidney beaning or blackouts whatsoever.. Maybe you could ask your vendor to replace your zoom? Just an idea, thanks.. Best,.",0
"I've had it a few months so it would be too late for an exchange I think. I have no eye positioning, kidney beaning or blackout problems with my UWA's. The 4.7 has some eyeball reflection, none in the 6.7. Last time out none of my EP's were delivering (meades, stratus or zoom) so I attributed that to bad seeing or possibly the scope not at thermal equilibrium. Next time I get a night out with good seeing and hopefully warmer temps, I plan on doing a more in depth side by side comparison with my zoom and other EP's..",0
"I've had the Meade UWA for just a few days and have just used it twice, maybe that's why I have the beaning issue, more time with the EP may eliminate it eventually. Perhaps also, I've been spoiled by using the Hyperion zoom too much (in spite of having other excellent EPs in the stable) - eye positioning with different angles does not bean at all, unlike in the Meade where I have to find the exact angle/approach for a clean view..  As for the Hyperion zoom exchange, don't they have a one-year warranty if purchased new? If you're not satisfied with it I think the vendor should be obliged to replace it..  Best,.",0

Aside from the obvious difference in quality & finish, not to mention the brass compression ring of the WO for mar-less EP use, the WO gave a clearer and sharper view (using a Pentax XW7mm EP) than the no-name diagonal, it's as if there is a thin film on the no-name that gave it a degraded view compared to the WO.

"Here's a brother of the Hyperion zoom, the Hyperion Aspheric 31mm:. Got to take it out for a spin last night using the C8 SCT and it performs very well indeed. To test, I pointed the scope towards the Southern Cross, the smallest of 88 constellations, which is low but very distinct above the horizon, around 15-deg latitude, just about where the Polaris is at the opposite end of the celestial pole:. Then pointed to a cluster of stars (visible to the naked eye) just to the left and a little below beta Crux (Mimosa) and found the jewel of the night, the ""Jewel Box"" (NGC 4755 or Kappa Crusis):. And wow! What an absolutely stunning and enchanting sight the Jewel Box is on the 72-deg view of the Aspheric 31mm, it's eye candy with the giant red, blue and white stars displaying their wares to the max (the pic above does not even begin to do justice to what is actually seen on EP). It is one of the most beautiful star clusters that I view it longer than the great Orion Nebula because of the more colorful and splashy display. Moved the cluster to the field stop of the the Aspheric 31 and there is a little softness at the edge but overall the image is very crisp and contrasty; it's also a joy to use since its weight is not so heavy; in daytime use, there is some pincushioning but not so bad and the image is very sharp (later on, used the HypZoom at 12mm to get a more magnified view of the Jewel Box, and what a view it was - dazzling!). Here are the other components and underbelly view of the EP with the 2"" sleeve unscrewed:. It comes with a 1-1/4"" adapater and 4 caps, two for either extended or folded rubber eyecup.

"Brings to mind the amusing story told by an astro veteran when talk about zoom eyepieces ensued - he says that in the old days, the reputation of zoom EPs was so bad that one time he had one of those really cheap zooms to test for giggles and they (together with astro buddies) were at a dark site observing; he had the zoom on hand, about to give it a try, when suddenly some buddies came over to his scope and asked what it is that he was holding, and he suddenly and stealthily threw the zoom from his back onto the bushes nearby and said ""huh? nothing,"" and showed his hand palm up. No self-respecting amateur astronomer worth his salt would be caught dead with a zoom in hand in those days, lest he be thought of as a clueless and gullible novice that had been had by a cheap zoom that promised heaven and earth to the unsuspecting buyer. This must be the reason why resistance to zoom EPs is still present to this day. Well things have changed, the zoom has come a long way from ill-repute in the old days and he is now a proud owner of a spanking brand new Hyperion zoom (through my prodding) which he will never throw away onto the bushes ever.

On axis, both the zoom @8mm and XW7 images appeared equally sharp showing the Omega Centauri globular as a fuzzy ball but stars within are not resolved. It is hard to tell the difference between cluster images presented by the two - they appear identical, especially since the AFOV is about the same, at or around ~70-deg. Switching back and forth between the 2 EPs, stars will blink in and out sporadically in moments of atmospheric stability at a spot in the periphery of the cluster in both EPs but the zoom has an additional spot where the star pop out nearer to the center in two instances. This is not in any way an intensive and exhaustive comparison of the two but just an initial observation. The XW did have the better eye relief and the field stop was very sharply defined as compared to the zoom. Stars in both EPs were tack sharp to the edge. Conclusion is that the zoom can hold its own when pitted against the premium Pentax XW EP. Will conduct more tests as weather permits.. Best,.",0

"I have a question to all Hyperion owners. I am considering a Stellarvue F50M2 or SV50, which are the same. I know that fixed Hyperions are able to come to focus, but I only found a negative post for Hyperion zoom. Does anybody have this finder/ mini refractor and tried his zoom with it? It would make an excellent travelscope with Hyperion and, possibly, a Powermate, from 8-60x.. I am going to buy it anyway as a finderscope, but the possibility of use with Hyperion Zoom makes it more worthy for me as a spotting scope. Most spotting scopes use zooms (up to 60x) for a reason.. Thank you all..",0
"Yes, while the Pentax XW 7mm is just 4.7"" in height, the 5mm and 3.5mm are taller, 5.0"" and 5.4"" respectively.. Best,.",0

"Good plan that you have there! I've encountered a focusing problem with the Hyperion zoom when used with the WO ZS66SD refractor fitted with a 2"" OPT dielectric diagonal, in-travel focus is short by around an inch or so in order to reach focus with the zoom. So, I modified the EP lip of the diagonal (which can be screwed off) and replaced it with a custom-built low profile lip as shown here (the bare aluminum part):. Fixed the focusing problem and I am now able to use the zoom with the WO66, which is what I used to compare the Pentax with the zoom.. With regards to the SV 50mm finder, I have a 50mm finder lying around somewhere - will try to see if the Hyperion zoom can be used with it and be able to reach focus. Will report back on findings, pls stand by.... Best,.",0
"Check this out, zooms LNIB:. They're from Italy! (But from the pic, the 1-1/4 sleeve is chrome plated not black, it's best to ask what generation the zooms are.). Best,.",0
"Yes Hernando, I have followed your experience and I understood that with short focal length refractors Hyperion zoom might have a problem. Well, SV50 has an even shorter focal length, at 200mm! But it has its own diagonal, which I think is no wise to modify. You can see  pictures here  Hyperions look lovely on it, but the zoom would be very convenient. Otherwise I am considering a Speerswaller 8-5 Zoom. That would give me higher magnification and could add functionality from the point the Hyperion stops at 8mm. It would give me also planetary with my Nexstar, from 190x to 300x, with 80 degrees FOV. One zoom starts where the other stops.. Problems: It is a bit expensive, tall and heavy and, most important, I do not know if it can focus with SV50 either.. If anybody knows it would be appreciated.. Otherwise, what about TV zoom 6-3? But FOV is narrow and it asks for more money..",0

"Kkokkolis, here' the Hyperion zoom with a 50mm finder:. The finder scope came with an Antares 6"" refractor and it is actually a straight-through finder. I just removed the end lens, added a right angle diagonal and plugged the zoom in it. Unfortunately, with this configuration, it does not focus, like it needs more in-travel racking to be able to achieve focus. But this is only for the above finder, not sure if the SV50 will be the same.. I've also considered the Speers Waler 5-8mm zoom before but it is very long, they call it a ""cannon"" because of its length but it has good reviews and performance. Settled instead for a Nagler 5mmT6 which I like very much and gets a lot of use with my refractors. The TV 3-6mm zoom would have been nice, but the narrow 50-degree AFOV is a deal-breaker for me - orthos would be a cheaper alternative in this case, like the Baader Genuine Ortho of which I have the 6mm.. Hoping that if ever you get the SV50mm finder, that the HypZoom will work with it. Good luck!. Best,.",0
"Since these are being restocked and shipping April 5th most sites, I figured it's time to make a decision on my next EP.. I have an XT8.  It's my first scope, so with that being said, I only have the 25mm Orion Sirius Plossl that came with it.  I quickly added a TeleVue 8mm Plossl and TeleVue Powermate 2x Barlow to take advantage of a sale and Mars in January.  That's all I have.. The zoom seems like a good idea because it covers a lot of ground as far as focal length for very little money.  But I kind of have a problem with the FOV only getting to that Hyperion 68 degrees at its highest mag since what I really need right now is a medium power and EPs with wider FOVs.. What do you guys think?  Should I just go ahead and get a zoom here, or just a fixed Hyperion EP like the 13mm?.",0

"Hi, welcome to the forums and to our little thread here!. If you're gonna spring for a medium FL eyepiece, you might want to check out the Explore Scientific 14mm which is on sale for $99 - I ordered one myself. Whereas the Hyperion 13mm will give you a 68-deg AFOV, the ES 14mm will give you a wider 82-deg view. An alternative would be the Meade 14mm UWA Series 5000 which is also on sale, but more expensive at $159. But even if you have all these fixed-focal length EPs, the Hyperion zoom will always be a welcome addition to anyboydy's EP box, it's just so convenient to use and quite a performer, not to mention it being an excellent grab-n-go eyepiece. Your choice, good luck!. Best,.",0

"I got my Zoom last thursday and used for a mini-messier marathon (clouds cut it short, very short).  I was not so impressed on first use.  I tried to one-hand rotate the zoom and the 1.25"" adapter started to unscrew instead.  Then I felt like I was looking down a tube, unlike my Hyperion 13 which felt like I was in the image.  I almost returned it.  Decided to try again last night and now I'm a beleiver!  I checked the image quality against the Hyperion 13.  Stars were sharper to the edge in the Zoom.  This is on a Lightbridge 10 at F/5.  Contrast nearly identical.  The only downside is the field stop on 24 is lower so 21 and 24 looked almost identical.  As for the looking through a tube, it's all in the eye cup.  Set it up too high and it'll do that to ya.. Anyone wanna buy a nice Hyperion 13?.",0

"I have Hyperion Zoom, Hyperion 13 (and 31, 24, 17, 8 and Fine Tune Rings 14 & 28) and Explore Scientific 14 80 degrees.. I want to say that Hyperion Zoom @ 12mm and Hyperion 13mm have a wonderful FOV. You can take it all at once and you need to move your eye just a bit to see the field stop.. Explore Scientific is a very lovely EP but the glass near the eye is much smaller than Hypeerion's 13mm and again smaller than the zoom's. The eye relief is worse also. So you have to get your eye very close and then move your eyeball around at extreme angles to see the field stop. There you can see some coma and chromatic aberration. It looks not like a window to space, better described as a keyhole (a somewhat big keyhole) to space. I felt like a starpeeper. Both Hyperions are much more comfortable!. After I got my ES14 I decided I would not buy any more ES (until I try the ES100 at least) and bought my 5 Hyperions at once. Hyp 31, 24 & 17 give me FOV over the zoom, and 13 and 8mm where bought used, to reach lower focal lengths I might need occasionaly (with FTR, down to 4.2mm). I could skip 13 and maybe 17mm having the zoom, but I thought it is a good collection, I couldn't resist.. Clearly I prefer Hyperion 13mm over ES 14mm in overall everynight use, although the center of the FOV performance seems equal (not tested very hard yet though).. I recommend Hyp Zoom> Hyp 13> ES14.. Only one Hyp 24 (or 21 which I do not have) can supplement the lack of FOV Hyperion has at 24-20mm.. Conclusion: ES14 has more AFOV than Hyp 13 and Hyp zoom @ 12, but Hyp AFOV is the most usable ergonomically..",0
"Peter much thanks! Very nice quote; I was only trying to help newbies get the best value for their money, and I do respect and accept that the Hyperion zoom may not be what everyone had in mind. Best,.",0

"Thanks for asking this question, tinkered around a bit with the Orion 9x50 finder to find out (pardon the pun) what can be done, and it has gotten me all excited because there's a good possibility that it will work!. The zoom focuses at the configuration/spacing above, so that means that an adaptor can be fabricated and will result in a zoomable 50mm scope! Right angle diagonal is not necessary since it is such a small scope that it can easily be pointed in almost any direction. Will be embarking on this new project soon, thanks to you and Kkokkolis for planting the seeds for this Hyperion zoom little scope that can! Will post once it is done. I'm so excited! Best,.",0

"That's what I thought so too with the zoom's published max ER of 15mm. Some time back I did an experiment and tried the HypZoom with reading glasses on just to see if it would work out. @ 12mm, no problem at all, the entire field was comfortably visible just looking straight through (same with the 16, 20, & 24mm) with glasses on and it was only at 8mm that I had to move my eyes to get to the edge of the field but it was still possible. The reason why I conducted the experiment was to compare ERs on the HypZoom with the WO 7.5-22.5mm zoom, which I still have, and the result is that ER in both EPs were about the same gauging it from having to use both with glasses on  - if the published max ER of the WO zoom is accurate at 18mm, I would guess that the HypZoom's actual ER would also be at or about the same figure. YMMV may be the key when using the HypZoom with glasses.. Best,.",0

"I wear regular light framed glasses with thin lenses and I cannot use eyeglasses with them. I don't call having to squish my glasses into my face to get the view with glasses on very comfortable eye relief. The zoom is vignetted for me terribly if I try to view with glasses on. I am also not suprised about someone finding paint specks in the zoom. You wouldn't see them if viewing at night, but I sent mine back for the same reason plus an eyelash in between the lenses on the first one. The second one came back and was sent back immediately for the paint flecks in it. I guess they're getting better because there was no eyelash in it this time. I didn't even get to see it. The scope shop I bought it from tested it for me and sent it back first thing. They need some better QC it seems. I have to wait until April now. I only had it two weeks before discovering the first defects. Great zoom when I had it though. Even without glasses. I might do some imaging with it someday though and don't particularly care for paint chips in a place I can't clean out. The zoom is not a cheap piece either. For the money, they need to get it right with no lens defects..",0
"On a brighter note, maybe I am getting all the bad luck on the zoom to make up for my good luck with my other equipment. Everything else I have bought has been great quality. Some of the equipment I've bought has been said to be a gamble (my binos, optics on a mass produced scope mirror, other eyepieces, etc) but I have found it all to perform above the norms. Particularly my mirror in my skywatcher. Bad luck changes eventually and I'm sure the replacement zoom I get in April will be fine. If not, then three times a charm and I will go with single EP's and maybe a speers-waler zoom..",0
"Am with you on this one and I have stated it before as well; if I recall, there was a question raised before as to where the zooms were made and it turned out that it was not made in Germany but rather, possibly in China or something. If it were wholly made in Germany, QC/QA would be a non-issue for sure, but I would imagine that the retail price will rise up exponentially bringing it well beyond the very reasonable price point at this time, thus maybe precluding mass ownership, myself included. Let's just be vigilant when receiving a new one, thanks for all your constructive inputs.. Best,.",0
"Yes, Hernando, I will take the hint.. I wear glasses full time and especially need them to read, use computer screens or do any fine detail work.. The Hyperion Zoom is my work horse.  It is my main eyepiece for viewing other than when I want a real low power, wide FOV view.. I have tried viewing both with and without my eyeglasses through various eyepieces, but I get a better view with my eyeglasses.  So I use them all the time.. I keep the twist eyecup on the Hyp Zoom in the down position and use it with my eyeglasses all the time.. And it works great.  I did buy a 4.9 Siebert Star Splitter, but I find it doesn't work as well with the glasses, so when I want to view at higher magnifications, I tend to just use the Hyp Zoom with a 2x barlow.. Plus I love the ease with which I can find the ideal magnification for the night's viewing rather than swapping multiple eyepieces, trying to find the perfect magnification.. I won't be giving up this eyepiece!.",0
"I agree.  After reading these reports I checked my recently purchased ""new to me"" Hyp zoom out VERY carefully in the daytime, and was extremely pleased to see that it had no discernable defects whatsoever.  Hopefully when the current backorder situation is resolved there'll be enough in stock so that any new EPs that happen to be afflicted with any of the aforementioned issues can be replaced immediately, with a minimum wait time for their owners.  Or even better, maybe with this new run of EPs they'll have worked most of the bugs out..",0
"It's been 30 days now since I last saw my zoom and I am really missing it. Thankfully I have gotten hooked on clusters and I have some nice wide view pieces to look through. If I would have known it was going to take this long to get a replacement, I probably would have kept it a little longer. I really had no idea that I had defects until the daylight view, then after knowing, it just bugged me to pay as much as I did and get something that had problems. Small dust specs or paint flakes aren't really noticeable on most objects at night. If I get a third bad one, I give up. Not on zooms though. There is always a Zeiss or Leica.....",0
"Garland, thanks a lot for obliging us! And thanks too for the tips on how to use the HypZoom effectively with glasses along with your other experiences and strategies in using one.

"In choosing the material to be used for coupling the Hyperion zoom with the 50mm Orion finder OTA, have considered the fact that when using a 2"" filter housed in a metal (aluminum) case, it will scrape out the black paint on the inside thread of the zoom's 2"" sleeve - can cause paint specks to contaminate the lens, a complaint that we've heard before. Thus selecting an industrial grade Engineering Plastic (used for making gears) that won't scrape off black paint seemed cleaner and more appropriate:. Here's how the finished adapter looks like:. Right hand thread screws on to the zoom's 2"" sleeve filter female thread:. While the other end goes onto the 50mm OTA:. Going on to the scope mount, the Orion 50mm uses a generic Synta-type saddle & shoe which can be perched above any tripod adapter:. Had to bore a hole on the saddle and threaded it to accept standard 1/4""-20tpi tripod screw:. Finally, the HypZoom 50mm mini-scope mounted on a WO TR-188 tripod (or any other tripod):. Tested it on the moon last night, worked great, the FOV at zoom's 8mm setting can easily fit in 4 full moons; focusing is done through the objective lens focuser, or via the extra long thread of the adapter; maximum magnification has craters along the terminator and elsewhere well defined, I believe outreach goers can be impressed with the image produced considering the minuscule size of the scope; also scanned the skies below the moon and came upon the Peiades star cluster, the entire ensemble was well framed inside the view - such a pretty sight, it made my night. This little HypZoom pocket/travel mini-scope really cuts it! Best,.",0
"Earlier, came across a post in another thread about not so favorable comparison of the Pentax XW and HypZoom and believe it's a stretch. To be fair, I've posted before in another thread my favorable impression of my newly received Pentax XW 7mm:.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. The Pentax XW7 - I haven't had the chance yet to use this head-turner on the heavens, but if daytime use is any indicator, it's quite a performer, razor sharp image with little pincushioning (i.e., compared to the Naglers or the pincushion king - the Panoptic). It's a beautiful eyepiece, exuding top-notch quality and finish by just holding and tinkering with it; here's a pic up close:.  (pic).  Notice the BIG eye lens, and combined with a long eye relief of 20mm this EP is very very comfortable to use, a little kidney-beaning but no blackouts; I could imagine peering through this EP for extended periods of time without tiring, and the twist-up helical eyecup is a work of art, movement is precise and buttery smooth, it takes almost 5 revolutions to fully extend for exact height selection - even then, with the eyecup up at max, the whole full-eye wide 70-degree AFOV is still complete for viewing right up to the field stop which very sharp and flawless - this will certainly help eliminate extraneous and unwanted light when viewing at night in an urban setting:.  (pic).  Here's the bottom view, nice!:.  (pic).  If there is ever an eyepiece that comes close to being perfect - image wise, comfort, engineering, ergonomics, quality and finish, the Pentax XW7 would be a contender.. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.  Have brought along my Pentax XW7mm to star parties and my American astro buddy says he's getting blackouts with it, and just confirms my experience with it too. Maybe, just need more time to get used to the long ER. Other veterans who've looked thru it are not really wowed beyond belief, just another EP to test, but I've gotten rave reactions to the HypZoom. Just for me, the totality of the utility of the EP comes foremost and if I were to sacrifice a bit of performance, that would be fine. Many have commented that it's not far behind the best EPs there are and given a choice between having one or the other, choosing the HypZoom is a no-brainer. Just 2 cents..  Best,.",0

I was number 9 in line when I ordered February 19, and I'm still number 9, with 9 more lined up behind me now as well.  They said they've placed an order for 38, so it's just a matter of waiting for manufacturing of these eyepieces to address the demand.. I gave mine to my nephew over the holidays, when I tested several of my eyepieces with the 90mm Orion Mak I'd bought him two years earlier.  The Hyperion zoom was fantastic with his scope.  My always-good-performing Orion 9mm Expanse was absolutely useless in his scope, with horrible kidney beaning.  I was so surprised and impressed how well the Hyperion zoom performed.  It was easier for me to leave my Hyperion with him and buy a new one for myself, than to order one special for my nephew, but back then I had no idea there was a waiting list.

He said that there are no ""definitive dates"" in the Astronomy industry (with a smiley  ) and that all he had on the zoom was listed on the product page about the Hyperion zoom in their website and that there are no additional info beyond that. A check with their website has this notice:. So I guess that is as definitive as one can get as to the shipping date for those who have the zoom on back order. Hope this helps.. Best,.",0
"It is like that everywhere. Mid April. Grrr..  I did get a price quote on the Leica. I was mentioning to my dealer about the possibility of my zoom coming back and being defective for a third time, that I would just give up and go for the Leica zoom. He said hang on a minute and did a quick price check for me. Not as bad as I thought but would take me most of the rest of the year to save for it. Those are not running out of stock anywhere they sell right now and I expect would never have that problem because of their price. I am about 90% committed to saving for it now. I did factor in the custom 2"" barrel piece and a nice modular zoom in my savings.",0
"You said: ""Earlier, came across a post in another thread about not so favorable comparison of the Pentax XW and HypZoom and believe it's a stretch."". I assume this is the post you were referring to.  Regardless of how much you love the zoom, others do have their own opinions, and should not be considered a ""stretch"", when they post them, liking another eyepiece over the zoom.  Depending on equipment, usage, & a person's eyes, everyone has their own ideas as to what they see & like..",0
"Thanks, point well taken. But if a poster continuously picks on a certain EP which others do like too, it needs pointing out also, don't you think so? Like why almost like clockwork, the above post picks out the HZ to eat for lunch, why not, say, Orions or the Vixen LVW, the Meades, Celsestrons, Explore Scientific, TMB, Siebert, and others,.. why has it always has to be with him, that of the HZ? Can he not respect too that other people happen to like the HZ, some more so than others? Alright, it's a personal matter I know and will respect that out of deference to you. I concede and will further refrain to your liking. Thanks.. Best,.",0
"Congrats!  The Leica ASPH zoom is the holy grail of zooms, my dream zoom actually, except for the >$1k price tag; we mere mortals will have to content ourselves with the Hyperion zoom But I believe Leica zoom owners will attest that it is well worth the entrance price. Good luck!. Best,.",0
"I think it is all YOUR fault, Hernando! You're the reason I got mine - glad I got it before the rush..",0
"Yes, April is what I'd been reading everywhere.  I wasn't expecting that Optcorp had actually been filling any of their orders, and on that count I got what I expected.  Everybody is waiting... waiting... waiting.... Well April is just around the corner, so maybe there will be some good news soon!.",0

"Continued to test the HypZoom min scope - EP end:. Business end:. Or is it the other way around?  Last night was another good night for a scope run and waited for a favorite object to peak at it's highest, the Omega Centauri globular cluster:. With the target hovering at around 30-deg latitude (red x), zoomed out to 24mm for finder mode and guided the mini-scope to the area of the target glob, it was easy locating it using Alpha/Beta Centauri and Crux as guide, then a fuzzy nebulous ball appears into view; zoomed in successively to 20, 16, 12 and finally 8mm it comes to life to show a fine nicely framed image of the majestic Omega Cen, a sight to behold in the small scope, which was a bit surprising, considering it's diminutive size. As expected, stars were not resolved, but nevertheless it gave a great view of the celestial wonder. Another good night for the Hyperion zoom mini scope, The Little HZ Scope that can! Thanks.. Best,.",0
"More tinkering tonight (because of the cloudy night) with the HypZoom mini scope came up with this:. A paparazzi-long camera zoom lens! Took a quick-n-dirty test shot of the moon which partly peeked out from the clouded sky at a very low 15-deg. latitude:. Just a hurried-up (before the clouds cover the moon again) and raw, unprocessed, not so well focused hand-held test shot with no tripod.. Best,.",0
"Hernando way to go Bro,you really put the ""frankenstein"" to that,I really love your posts and have learned so much from them,I wouldnt worry about the ""flak"" all geniuses catch that,keep it up Bro this is what makes CN such a great place to be",0
"Thank YOU, your post honestly perks me up beyond anything and am just so happy that there may be those who like my posts. Your comments are most appreciated Bro! Much thanks!   Best,.",0
Pro Noblem Dude,0
Just went outside and snapped this picture hand held camera. thru the Hyperion Zoom plus the 2.5X Powermate..,0
Nice pic! What fl was the zoom at? What camera?.,0
Zoom was on 8mm. Camera Fuji F-30  Shutter speed 250. ISO 200.  Scope Stellarvue SV-70ED.,0
That is a nice clear shot. I look forward to trying some quick snaps of the moon with the zoom when I get my new one in April. Also one of the reasons I had to make sure it had no defects that would show up in a snapshot..,0
"Agree, Phil's moon shots are real sharp stunners, wouldn't think they're just hand held shots. Thanks, keep 'em coming!. Best,.",0
"What about terrestrial viewing? The zoom scope presents a down-side-up image (used it for viewing the moon during daylight, craters at terminator are distinct) - not so much of an issue for astronomical use, but nevertheless disconcerting when you're viewing a rare dodo bird.  So what to do? Hmmm, here's the map:. That's right, the William Optics 45-deg erect image diagonal goes into focus at the above position with the Hyperion zoom all boarded up. Fodder material for a new project, a HYPERION ZOOM ERECT-IMAGE POCKET SCOPE? We'll see.., any inputs are welcome, thanks.. Best,.",0
"Last night's moon shot using the 50mm HypZoom mini-scope:. Not bad for a small 50mm scope/paparazzi zoom lens? (I know, Phil, needs a little sharpening.) Such a charming little scope. Best,.",0
"About two years ago I had a 50mm Stellarvue ""Little Rascal"". scope. I put a Nagler on it and snapped this. My 50mm shot..",0
I was wrong in the eyepiece. I used a Hyperion. Here's my. little setup. 50mm scope.,0
I put the Panoptic 22mm in for a low power 19X shot with. the SV-70ED the other night..,0
"That camera is hard to find now. Pretty amazing shots with it. Do you have any shots of DSO's with that camera and the hyp zoom? Really impressive moon shots. I have a dob with no tracking and i am pretty interested in being able to grab some quick shots with the zoom. I have an older Nikon camera, but I don't think it would be up to snuff taking pictures with it. I'll give it a try when my zoom gets back to me. I imagine this is something you have some experience in before getting these shots, but seeing your results really makes me hopeful I can come out with something decent after some practice..",0
"I use my 3-step method. Set built in 3sec timmer, Focus,. press shutter, Hold on tight.   Last step very important..",0
"Phil, nice setup! Will the HypZoom come to focus on this scope? Thanks.. Best,.",0
"I was told that it doesn't come to focus. I ordered a SV F50W which is the same (finder version) and I am going to try myself.. Hernando,from this question your Hyperion Zoom Miniscope emerged! I want one myself!.",0
"Phil,. I'm impressed..  What is the camera you are using?. Cheers,. Rick in Tennessee.",0
"Thanks! Congrats on the coming SVF50W, do let us know how it works out.. Oh yes, credit goes to you for initiating and planting the seeds for the emergence of what Reddog15 dubbed as ""frankenstein"" miniscope ; And as a follow-through, am now working on the Hyperion Zoom Erect-Image PocketScope! This thread is like the Great Orion Nebula, a hot-bed and birthplace of HypZoom-related products and work-arounds; thanks again, and keep those great ideas of yours flowing!. Best,.",0
Orion's Nebula is dwarfed in comparison. The Great Hypzoomian Nebula?.,0
"Oh no Hernando, i don't need any credit. I just wanted to remind you that Hyperion Zoom can't focus with the SV50.. But maybe it could with the new Baader 10x60 erect image Vario finder! ,19063.",0
The camera I use is a Fuji F-30.   But I think any ditigal. camera would work. Just make sure you can control the ISO. and shutter speed. Cheap cameras work real well. Some of. my best shots were with a 40.00  Alpeck..,0
"Alright thanks; seeing in the pic that the Hyperion used is the Aspheric 31mm, slid it out of its pouch to test on the most finicky of diagonal/small refractor, together with the HypZoom:. Scope used is the WO66 and the regular unmodified OPT 2"" dielectric diagonal. The scope does focus with the Aspheric 31mm but would not focus on the zoom, needing around an inch more in-focus for the zoom, which may be the same case with the Baader 10x60 in pic, the only chance the zoom getting into focus is if there is sufficient in-travel racking. But seeing in the Baader pic that the diagonal can be removed, one solution seems available, that of a ~$25 prism diagonal that I picked up in the used mart (according to the seller it's a Vixen, but I suppose any other like Celestron/Orion/Meade prism will do):. Success! There's even a 2-1/2 complete revolution in-travel allowance from the Hyperion zoom's focus point. Can only conclude that this solution will work with any small finder/refractor with a removable-type diagonal. Do hope this backyard theory works. Best,.",0
"Thanks! Couldn't think of anything better than this, +1 here. Best,.",0
"Looking further at the dismantled image of the Baader Vario-Finder 10x60  (blow-up of 2nd image), it seems that the diagonal is a proprietary design and might not accept standard 1-1/4"" diagonals, but it does look as if an adapter can be made to couple the Vixen prism diagonal with the Baader's focuser-cum-eyepiece holder component. Gotta have an actual unit on-hand to ascertain - maybe Baader can lend me a unit?  Best,",0
"Up for grabs:. Of course there's always one looking for it, i.e. if you want to let go of yours:. (Both posted on the same day.). Best,.",0
Since there are two active Hyperion Zoom threads; this one will now be locked; leaving the newest one open.    Thanks everyone!.,0

"No, it's not an inflammation of your Takahashi!   Instead, I picked up a used FS-102 on AMart and will be doing visual comparisons against my SV-105T as soon as I can.  The Tak should arrive today/tomorrow.  I have a MT Pro and I'll see if I can mount both scopes together for doing side-by-sides!     Only issue is that the FS has only 1.25"" visual back and I only have a 2"" diagonal.   Oh well, I might have to view straight through to compare.   Stay tuned.. pics will be provided when I can..",4
Resistance is futile.........halt and be converted!. Rex.,0
"How does the FS-102 only have an 1.25"" visual back? Even my Tak Sky 90 had the 2"" focuser with an 1.25"" adapter. You are gonna love the veiw through a Fluorite doublet Rob. There is indeed something special to the view and a slight contrast advantage. With the warmer image due to only two elements, planetary viewing is particularly satisfying and very 3-D like with binoviewers. I have no doubt you will see a difference...enjoy and report your first light!.",1
"Tr,  All the early Taks came with a 1.25"" eyepiece adapter. They started supplying a 2"" adapter maybe 8-10 yrs ago.. The draw tube on the Tak 2.7"" focuser is threaded for 72mm, then there is a 72-43mm adapter plate, followed by a 1.25"" eyepiece holder with 43mm threading. the Tak 2"" eyepiece holder just threads directly to the 72mm draw tube..  Rex.",1
Rex.....YOU are responsible for my Tak addiction.. >Mark.,2
As the happy owner of an SV105T and the lust-after-er(?) of a Takahashi I eagerly await your review!.,1
"Your welcome, Rex",0
"Rob, I think that the views through your FS-102 will make you smile  Looking forward to your comparison.. Green is good. Or is it.. green is soothing? Or green is expensive. This is addicting (astronomy and toys). And the FS-102 doesn't disappoint. Great performer!. Clear skies,. John.",1
"Rob, I'm really excited for you!  And as you know, this is coming from someone who just bought his own first Tak scope (an FS-102 just like yours) a couple of weeks ago.  I sincerely hope that you don't get swamped with bad weather, competing work and personal obligations, etc., like I did right after the scope arrived.  But at least I did get to observe through it briefly the night that it arrived; hope you get the same opportunity!",0
"Hey Rob, dibs if you decide to sell it! Just kidding, congrats on a fine telescope. I've owned one in the past, and can tell you that it's a fine instrument. Beware though, it may lead to the purchase of an FS-128!.",1
I could suffer with a FS-128!. Thanks.. Will send pics in a day or two.  Too much home stuff going on..,0
"I cured my Takitis... by selling them all Only ONE Tak I lust after - the FC-100. That'd make me very happy, and a nice companion to my Vixen FL102S.",0
I had a FCC-100 years back but sold it.. Doh!.,1
Your going to enjoy that scope soooo much!!. congratulations!!.,0
"Here they are, ready for action... my SV-105T and my FS-102, on the MT Pro..",5
"Very nice, Rob!  Can't wait to hear the shootout results.   Also, please let me know what you think about the JMI Motofocus, as I've been trying to decide whether or not to get one..",0
"Well ,  tonight was a bit of a dud.  The FS102 has only a 1.25"" visual back and my star diagonal is 2"".  I tried viewing straight through but could not reach focus. So, no first light yet with the Tak.. I tried viewing with the 105 but the Mosquitos drove me in after awhile. They were swarming!. Looks like I will have to invest in a 2"" visual back..",0
"If there's one thing that I don't like about Tak scopes, it's the need for all the proprietary adapters needed to make everything work properly.  But once you get your system up and running, it's really quite a pleasure to behold!. My recommendation is to get the 2"" visual back with Baader Clicklock attachment that I PM'd you about the other day.  I was lucky enough that my scope came with one when I purchased it, and I really think that it works quite well..",1
Have fun comparing the two Rob...are you keeping only one?.,0
"Hi Tim,.   I plan to keep just one.  Looks like I'll be buying that clickstop 2"" visual back. Would love to have both but... gotta stretch those astro dollars.. My wife saw my setup last night and told me. "" Don't you want to get a bigger one?""   She wants me to get another ""Yuri scope"".. the TEC-140.. I guess size does matter after all!   : ).   Anyway, this got me thinking.. If I sell off both these, I could swing a used TSA-120 or FS-128!  Hmmmmm........",0
Can't wait to hear your comparison Rob!!.,0
And a Thermacell.,0
"Or a Bug Shirt,",0
Man...do I ever need one of those!!!  :john:.,0
I had a similar feeling about the proprietary adapters so I upgraded both Tak focusers with Feathertouch and at the same time converted to Astro-Physics accessories.  I am a much happier camper now.  You will like your scope!.,0
"I have the Elite Bug Shirt and pants, 100% effective against mosquitoes. Looks a little goofy but who cares. I use the microfiber version because of the heat and humidity here, cooler than the cotton..",1
,0
Awesome Seinfeld reference!,0
I purchased the shirt and pants at your suggestion a few years back after reading another complimentary post that you made.  These are awesome and really work.  Just had it at Cherry Springs last week..,1
the disease is spreading......,4
I'm feeling Tak green with envy!!.,0
"Well, life is not cooperating.  Very bad weather and the few good nights, other life stuff got in the way.   Still hopeful to compare soon..   BTW, I have a lead on a used FS-128.  Would I be crazy to sell off both these 4"" apes and get the FS-128?    I'm thinking about it.. CS,. Rob.",0
"Rob,. The FS128 is definitely a step up from the FS102 ( I sold both my FS102 and TSA 102 after buying the FS128), but the FS128 is a much bigger scope ( only weighs about 17 lb) but it is long and make sure you have a mount that can handle it with the tripod extended for good viewing height.. Also it is not exactly grab and go so plan on a little more setup/ transport issues with a matching mount. But it is a keeper scope, I got one after selling my AP130GT and would never go back to the AP!. Rex.",1
What is fair market value for the FS scopes these days?.,0
"Rex, that is very high praise for the FS128, must be some great telescope.",0
"IMO the FS128 and AP130GT are different scopes, the AP is very fast and has to much curvature in the FOV for my tastes, don't get me wrong, it is a very high quality lens that resolves such targets as the moons of Jupiter , Uranus and Neptune as well as any scope out there, but for me the flatter FOV of the FS128 is more natural. I think that Astro Physics had photography and binoviewing in mind on that design, you can pair it with a MarkV binoviewer and have one of the best bino friendly scopes made, ( as the recommended 1.25x GPC extends the FR to a more natural F8), and if I were into binoviewing, I might own one, but for mono, I Prefer the FS128.. Rex.",0
"I had a Tak FS-102 that I sold to purchase a Tak FS-128 which I will be selling because I just acquired a Tak FS-152 (should be arriving soon). When I had the FS-102, I purchased a TSA-120 with the intention of replacing the FS-102 but found them to be very close so I sold the TSA-120 and kept the FS-102. Shortly after that, someone that I know locally aqcuired an FS-128 and I told him that if he decides to sell it to hit me up first. Less than a month later I ended up with an FS-102 and an FS-128. The jump up from the FS-102 to the FS-128 was much more noticeable and pleasing than the jump from the FS-102 to the TSA-120 and thus I thought that the FS-128 would be where my refractor quest would cease. Then someone told me that the FS-152 is not much longer (8 to 10 inches) than the FS-128 and this marinated in my mind until a couple of weeks ago that I saw a Tak FS-152 SV for sale and jumped on the opportunity. No I am waiting for the FS-152 to be delivered and will hopefully get a chance to compare both scopes side by side. Believe it or not I do consider my FS-128/DM6 combo a brab-n-go. I have had many small grab-n-go setups but I just did not find the views very pleasing especially when compared to my 16"" F4 dob. With the FS-128/DM6 combo, I grab the tripod with the mount and set it outside, then grab the light weight OTA, wait a few minuted for cool down and voila, wonderful views. I hope to be doing the same with the FS-152. Although this would not be the definition of a grab-n-go system, the little bit of extra effort is very worth it in my opinion..",1
"Sergio,. I agree that the FS128/DM6 combo is great and I think that the FS152/ DM6 will be just as good ( and portable) with the right tripod ( maybe something a little taller? than needed for the FS128?).. Rex.",0
I am currently using a double clamped Berlebach UNI 24 extended about 10 inches with the FS-128/DM6 combo with great results. I will raise it a bit more and see how it works with the FS-152. If it does not work well the I will probably have to get a Berlebach Planet or Losmandy HD..,0
I have noticed the Losmandy HD and pier extension is a popular setup with the DM6. I imagine it would certainly be rock solid..,0
I used to have one with my old TOA-130F and it was excellent. But I like the look of the Berlebachs more..,0
"Rob, you and I discussed long ago that a 5"" is thee ""sweet spot"" in our neck of the woods...HECK YEAH, get the Tak FS128!!! It was your long range plan to settle in with a 5"" anyway, do it now, life is too short. Then we'll get together and shoot out my AP130GT and your FS128 and see if Markab is full of it or not!",0
You do have a severe attack of Takitis  How do you feel??,0
i feel like looking for a mt160 to convert to dob or maybe try cn212.....,0
Oh.. This is serious! Guess theres no cure for you.. God bless you.,0
"Hi Tim,.   I decided to hold off and spend more time with my FS-102.  The FS-128 looks nice but,  I'd have to upgrade my mount as well to handle it.. Rob.",0
"Rob, to get the best out of the FS102 you should get a high quality diagonal, preferable a high quality prism. Should the Tak be the better one you probably won't see it with a mediocre (most dielectric) diagonals.. I've seen this many times with various diagonals on my former FS102",0
"Hi Rodi,.   Prism diagonal.. hmmm, interesting.  Do you have any recommendations?. Thx,. Rob.",1
I landed the TAK eyepiece turret with a prism diagonal from E-bay for my FS128NSV. I don't know how I got along with out one. BTW works fine with other scopes like my 14 inch Meade SCT..,0
"Yes.. in 1.25""  Tak's own prism is excellent. I bet the baader/zeiss 35mm prism is just as good or even better yet, but I don't have any experience with this one.. If two inches, Baader/Zeiss ""expensive"" If mirrored diagonals I would chose NONE dielectrics units. Not to say there isn't any good dielectric units out there, I just havn't seen one yet that match the sharpnes and contrast of the excellent prisms.. See Bill Paolini's Review!  Looking forward to your comparo.",0
"I found the Tak and Baader standard T-thread prism to be very close and the Baader Zeiss T- thread prism to be a step up in visual quality.. The advantage of the Baader Zeiss T- thread prism is that it provides a 34 mm clear opening ( compared to 32mm for the standard), so only the biggest 2"" eyepieces will viginnette, ( like the 21 Ethos, 35 Pan, 26 Nagler,- just,barely by 1mm, etc. All the smaller eyepieces will work just fine and with the T-thread diagonal you are ready for a binoviewer that accepts the T- thread,coupling.. Rex.",1
"Rob, how does the FS102 compare so far to your SV105?. Bill.",0
"Hello Rex,. I agree the baader/zeiss might be an even further step up in performance to the Tak prism, and one of the very best solution in high performing diagonals.. I just got the 35mm my self and havn't tried it out yet..",0
"I currently use the Baader standard T-thread prism with a 2"" Click lock Eyepiece Holder and I do not find the slight vignetting with my 21 Ethos or 31 Nagler offensive at all. The beauty of this setup is that to connect my Mark Vs all I have to do is release the screw on the T-2 Quick Release Connector, take out the Click Lock, put in the Mark Vs and that's it. No changing diagonals and such. Works great..",0
"Hi Bill,.   It's been frustrating.  I've had horrible weather this summer for observing. I've only had one night with them both setup and the seeing wasn't very good so it was inconclusive.  Obvious differences in focal length.  Both are very nice apos.  Hoping to get a decent clear nite soon, to compare them.. Rob.",0
"URGENT, URGENT... THIS JUST IN.... A NEW CASE OF TAKITIS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN MIAMI, FLORIDA. THIS IS THE RARE BUT NOT DEADLY FS-152 SV VARIETY. IF YOU HAPPEN TO SPOT THIS PERSON, DO NOT HESITATE TO ASK HIM TO LET YOU TAKE A PEEK. AGAIN, THERE HAS BEEN A NEW CASE OF TAKITIS REPORTED IN MIAMI, FLORIDA!!!! STAY TUNED FOR PHOTOS AND FURTHER REPORTS..",1
Beware the painful itching and swelling!.,0
Sergio - congrats on the new scope! after having an FS102 I always lusted after an FS152 but never ended up with one. Looking forward to your pictures!.,0
"Takititis, aka Takahashi's Curse, has taken a secure footholdon the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia.. Not my first, but the ones I intend keeping... NO regrets with either of these 2..",0
"I was fortunate to get an FS102 from a fellow club member at a good price. It came with a 2"" inch back, feather touch focuser, focal reducer, focal extender, scope rings, finder, soft carrying case, and a nifty home made adapter for a telrad.. Takahashi FS102. Even though it was meant for visual, it spends most of its time as my main imaging scope. Just need to get a better mount for it. The AVX is great for visual, but leaves a lot to be desired for imaging.. SBIG STF-8300. Yes, I can say that I have a case of Takitis. Them adapters however are sure expensive.. By the way, does anyone know the thread size for the finder mount? It did not come with those screws and I have been wanting to get some replacements. Every time I am at TNR, I forget to ask them..",0
"Congrats Jeff. Yours is the superb and final edition of the FS102, the FS102 NSV. They have some of the finest optics of any the FS series I've seen over the years. As a bonus they have a redesigned lens cell, which is even better than the older cell at retaining collimation according to Art..",0
"Very nice scope, Jeff! My recently-acquired Tak FS-102 has rapidly become my favorite scope, with the best optics (for visual use, at least) of any 4"" scope that I've ever owned. Now I just need better weather so that I can enjoy it more!.",0
"I had a Tak FS-102NSV and it was excellent. Now that I have a Tak FS-152SV, I will probably be looking for another FS-102 NSV once I recover from the cost of the FS-152SV.",0
"Wow, lucky you, Sergio!  Did you buy the FS-152 that was listed on CN S&S a few weeks back?.",0
Thanks guys. I have been very happy with the scope.  Guess I should do more visual with it. How can you tell it is an NSV?.,0
"The FS102 NSV has a sliding white rimmed dewcap, a lens cell similar in front appearance to the of the TSA102 and the serial number starts with NSV. See the attached picture of the front cell of my 2005 FS102 NSV. And yes, that is the tiny C5 next to the Tak..",0
Yea! lucky you Sergio  Many years I've lusted after the FS 152 and still does. Would like to read about your experience with this scope sometimes! I'm eagerly awaiting the fall to come with jupiter in good elevation to try out my newly arrived FS128..,1
"Those who have the FS 152 seem to be hanging on to them. Every time I ask a local guy to sell, he politely tells me ""Not gonna happen""!!!  I passed on the last one for sale new in the U.S. that Jerry Wise picked up and have kicked myself ever since...I think Jerry still has his as well...gotta mean something!",0
"Scott, yes it is the one that was listed a few weeks back. I had a chance to take it out last night and the views were, as expected, spectacular!!! Being that it was a full moon I did not get to look at much but Saturn sharp with loads of detail, Mars was a tight orange orb but no surface detail, M6 and M7 were beautiful and the full moon through the Mark Vs and 24mm Panoptics was just awesome. I can't wait for the fall/winter observing season since the humidity and mosquitoes last night were brutal!!! On a different note, I think that I am going to need a diferent tripod because the UNI-24 struggles a little bit with his scope..",0
"Thanks for the report and the picture, Sergio. Wow, that's a beautiful scope! It actually wasn't the one that I was thinking of, as I see that yours has a FT focuser (the scope in the ad that I saw had the standard Tak focuser).. If you want to go with another Berlebach tripod, the Planet might be a better match for that scope. How stable is the FS-152 on the DM6 mount?.",0
"Scott, I added the FT focuser..",0
"Oh, okay, then it was the scope whose ad I saw (as it's not like several of these are being sold every month). Good choice on the focuser. I've thought about upgrading the focuser on my FS-102 to a FT some day, but in my case that would make the cost of upgrading the focuser a very significant fraction of the cost of the entire scope. Still, if I find a good deal on a used 3"" FT one day, I may do it..",0
I'd get an AP wooden tripod. I have the older version with the dm6 and if it handled a 180 triplet it will do fine with the 152..,0
"Was this the FS152 that was on CloudyNights several weeks ago? I contacted the seller twice but he/she never returned the favor, even though the ad wasnot marked off as sold for some time.And I asked about it on the first day it was posted. Not the best customer service, in my opinion, but am glad the sale worked out for you with no hitches..",0
CN isn't perfect. I got no messages from you sorry.. You have a thing or two to learn before calling me out about service I respond to every message I get even the low ball offers..,0
"beautiful looking scope! The FT focuser is a nice upgrade, top of the line, although I do like the Tak's regular focusers too.. yes, we are in somewhat of a planetary dead zone right now, not much fun until Big J comes around again. I printed out finder charts for Neptune & Uranus, figured that would be a fun distraction over the next couple months..",0
"Didn't mean to offend you, but do you not agree that you didn't mark off the ad as sold for some time, unless it really did take 2-3 weeks to sell it?It seemed like a beautiful scope in good condition at a great price, and I am a Tak lover! Anyway,I've always taken customer service very conscientiously and this is reflected in my ratings as a buyer/seller. Again sorry if your feelings were hurt by my anonymous remark,but I'm sure any reasonable person would feel the same way by two full-priceinquiries/offers that were not responded to (and I've never had problems with CN before relaying messages in doing dozens of transactions), but no need fordirected, identifiablepersonal insults on this professional forum.. Cheers,.",0
,0
"Hi Joseph, I'm glad to hear that your sale worked out. Sounds like you made the buyer one very happy person!  Just so there's no further confusion about this scope, though, you may want to consider marking the ad as ""sold,"" assuming that this is the ad that we're talking about: http://www.cloudynig...te-doublet-apo/. If I've got the wrong ad in mind, then please excuse my mistake. Best regards..",0
"I didn't say you lowballed me I said I would've responded if I got your message. Sorry. cn was in the middle of the upgrade, maybe that's why? Someone else said recently they had trouble with PM's to me as well so I briefly posted my email in the shop and swap forums for that ad (not this ad).",0
"Just for the record, dealing with Joseph was a great experience. He informed me of everything that was going on and the deal was totally transparent. I would not hesitate to deal with him in the future if the opportunity were to come up. Also, I responded to the ad that he placed in the Fors Sale section in the Forums by sending him a PM and not the ad in the classifieds..",0
"Sergio, congratulations on your FS-152.. Beware, I've heard that Takitis can get worse before it gets better Enjoy your views!. Clear skies,. John.",0
"Well, I think that I am in the recovery stages. I have already been through a TSA-102, Mewlon 210, TOA-130F, two FS-60C's, Sky 90 II, FS-102NSV and FS-128 before I acquired the FS-152SV. Hopefully I am cured.",0
Or terminal? I think Taks are in your blood now!  Rex.,0
"The disease is just starting for me. I had never particularly wanted a Tak before. Not that I had any particular reason to not want one, as I certainly never had any dislike for them, but they just weren't ""on my radar screen,"" so to speak. Then a friend offered me one in near-mint condition for an astoundingly good price. I figured, the price looks good, and the seller is a guy that I know and trust. I'll try it out and if I don't think it's anything special, then I'm sure I can sell it without losing anything on the deal. Well, that's all it took to get me hooked! Now I'm souping it up with a fancy focuser, and keeping my eye out for an even larger Tak some day. Yep...it's definitely a disease for which there's no cure!",0
Doesn't the mesh across your face get in the way of looking through eyepieces? I don't see how this is practical for visual observing. Unless maybe you just want to fire up the scope to take pictures all night.  Mike.,0
I cut a small slot in the mesh to poke the eyepiece thru..,0
"Scott, it definitely is a disease! I've owned a couple of the 100/102's and a couple of the 128s. Only issue for me on the 128 is that the tube length and weight become significantly more and tend to tax my rather inadequate mount. But there is definitely a jump in the image ""bite"" on targets like Jupiter in comparison to the 102s. Really, for a purely visual observer, the Taks are really, really hard to equal, and I have not seen any offering actually beat it aperture-for-aperture for contrast and color saturation, including APs..",0
"You NEED to try the Tak reflectors next, my CN212 is so outstanding it should be illegal..",0
"NNOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Please don't tempt me, as it's already bad enough being a refractor-holic. I don't need to start coveting reflectors too..",1
"No, you need a Taf refractor and then a Tak Mewlon!.",0
"You're not helping, Rob!",0
"If you don't have a 5"" refractor you're going to wonder what took you so long. GN.",0
"Too late. I passed on the fs128. I figured I'd give more time to the 4"" apos..",0
"Don't fret, Rob. You really haven't had enough opportunity to fully appreciate your excellent 4"" apos, anyway. Just like me, what you need is not another scope, but some better weather. Don't worry--fall will soon be here!",0
What's big enough for an eyepiece is going to be plenty big enough for a skeeter. I think I'll keep slathering on the Deet and using those little fan gizmos.. Mike.,0
"You're right Scott, we just need some quality time under the stars with our 4"" APO's",0
a visit to tnr. sky90. fc-76. fsq106. µ180. tsa120. oh my.....,3
Nice display cases! It's probably a good thing that I don't live within driving distance of TNR.,0
The mesh has dual zippers around it so you can open a slot for the eyepiece on either side..,0
"This is true! At NEAF last year, I got to ""fondle"" the TAK 120 and even though I have a similar AP130GT, I almost bought the thing on the spot, twice. I had to walk away!!! The TAK allure is a truism once you get to see and touch them in person. I'm glad TNR is thousands of miles away!",0
I have to read these forums less often; i wanna get a TSA120 even i already have a Borg125SD.,0
Iprofoundly understandboththoughts of yours Chris.,0
"Having already owned a Sky90 and 2 60cs, I decided to move away and try something else and got that Borg125SD for that ultra light package. Well, really couldn't resist the Takisits..",0
"Paul,. Do you use your BORG 125SD also visually?. I would be interested to hear your opinion.....and yes although my stable is big enough a TSA120 has a magic attraction.  best regards. Chris.",0
"Chris,. I'm primarily an imager, so I can't really give good comparison to other scopes.. I know there are some other users on this forum that can give you good comments.. Regards,. Paul.",0
"Well, haven't posted in awhile. the weather has not cooperated for critical viewing but I can make the following comments:. Star Tests:.   The FS-102 has an incredibly good star test.. a keeper for sure. The TSA-120 has virtually a perfect star test.. need to check it a few more times.. The SV105T has an excellent star test as well. At first, it seemed identical to the FS-102 but the Tak I think tests a tad better.  All are. well above acceptable, or even good.. Viewing:.  The FS-102 has a slightly different character than the SV-105 for planetary. Both are very sharp and contrasty but the FS102 somehow is a tad more engaging when viewing Saturn and lunar.  The SV105 was delightful for low power, wide field viewing. My favorite for just scanning the milky way and getting lost in stars.  The TSA was also quite nice being brighter but, the focal length wasn't as conducive for LP viewing. No color seen on the lunar limb with all three.. Hard to call. I wish I could afford to keep all three. They each have a different personality. Definitely keeping the TSA-120 due to aperture and exquisite optics.. The fluorite doublet FS102 has always been among my favorites but, too close in FL to the TSA.  The SV105 is a delightful apo, friendly, and a performer.. If I could keep two I'd keep the SV105 and the TSA120, even though the optics on the FS102 seem a bit superior to the SV.. If I couldn't afford the TSA-120, I'd keep the FS-102. Always loved Tak fluorite doublets.. Anyway, enough rambling... the clouds are starting to affect my thought precesses..",5
"3 great scopes!  But in the long run, the TSA will blow the others away with more detail on DSO's, planets, etc.. There can be only one!",1
"Nice report, Rob! Hope you get plenty of clear dark nights this fall to fully check out the TSA-102. It would be interesting if you could keep the FS-102 until the winter so you could compare the thermal equilibration times of the doublet and the triplet in the cold NH winter..",0
"Very nice Rob, I am envious that you have the opportunity to use so many great telescopes. It makes me think of future refractors I would like to own which can't be good for the bank balance. I think I need to get out of here..",0
"You are going to get your brake Rob...with Fall, our best viewing season has begun and this week, starting Wednesday, high pressure will overtake the region through to next week! Get your sleep in during the day...here it comes.",0
"Clear tonight and looks like good forecast for the week!  Yay!. BTW, the FS-102 has been sold..",0
"Rob, other than just having it, why would you keep the SV-105 when you have the TSA120? As they need the same class of mount, its not like one is big and the other a small grab and go. Just curious?. Rex.",0
"Rex, I think that Rob has listed the SV105 for sale; it's just that the FS-102 sold first..",0
The SV105 is a quicker grab and a little better for wide field. I plan to sell it anyway. It's been posted.. I think a 80mm ED would be a better wide field companion for the TSA-120.. Down the road perhaps..,0
"Agreed, especially if you pair it with a lightweight easy to carry/setup mount.. Rex.",0
I agree with Rex as well.,0
"http://www.cloudynig...anyone-got-one/. My new FS60CB with Tak alt-az mount is doing well for me and when I get the optional 76 mm objective lens for it, should be my new "" I can live with this "" setup, giving me both wide field and general use viewing, plus the 60mm is a great daytime nature scope!. Rex.",0
"' Back in the day"" when the TSA and TOA lines first came out there were some unbelievable deals on new FS 102s, 128s and 152s... half price rings a bell.. I had the 102 and a CN 212.. like a dummy... I failed to strike while the iron was hot.. The FS series was fantastic.. love those doublets.. Best Regards,. Balok.",0
+1 on those Fluorite doublets,0
"The only fluorite doublet that I've ever looked through is my Tak FS-102. If they're all as good as my particular sample is, then I wholeheartedly agree with you!.",0
"Scott, if you don't mind my stealing your line..... I've never met a Takahashi Fluorite doublet I didn't like.. Just keep them away from me. So far, I've viewed through an FS-102 (two samples), two FC-60CB (one with the Q module also), an FS-78 and most recently, an FC-76. The views were great through my old eyes but YMMV. There are probably some bad samples somewhere but I think these have a pretty good reputation with most folks.. Clear views to all,. John.",0
"Thanks for sharing that info, John. I'd love to look through FS-128 and FS-152 fluorite doublets some day, but right now they're a little out of my price range. Maybe I'll meet someone with one of these at a star party some day..",0
"I HAD a Vixen FL102S for years - I thought it the perfect scope for me.. Then I was offered the Takahashi FC-100 (original model)..... I sold the Vixen.. Just WOW. Built like a tank, look beautiful, perform amazingly.. I use an FSQ85 for imaging AND visual, and I have to admit I think it is better than the FSQ106 (though not as photon grabbing of course).. Almost got a Tak TSA120 recently, but it meant having to sell the FC100 and maybe the FSQ85. I was glad when the seller changed his mind..",0
"Scott, I am planning on attending the Peach State Star Gaze on Sun, Mon & Tues (Oct 19-21) if the weather is good. I am considering taking my FS-152 instead of my dob If you are attending, you are more than welcome to observe with me..",1
"Lewis,. if may how do you find focusing your 85 for visual? I hear that its bigger cousin the 106 has a very narrow tolerance and while a great Astrograph isn't as great visually....",0
"No problem at all - it snaps to focus crisply - very obvious where focus is. I did find the 106 was finnicky in visual though.. For imaging, of course I just use a custom made bahtinov - can get focus VERY precise with the 85, and the drawtube lock - being the tried and true knob on top - does not shift the focus unlike the locking lever of the FSQ106 (there are work arounds for that too).. All in all, I MUCH prefer the 85 to the 106..",0
"Just for interests sake, here is a recent image I took through the FSQ85, and is only 1 hour total exposure - imagine what it'll do with more exposure time!. http://www.astrobin.com/120466/B/.",1
"Wow, great image..",0
"Sorry John, no can do   Here are some FC doublets.. Derek.",3
"OK, we have Sergio offering Scott to look through his FS-152 (yes, Scott did mention wanting to look through one). And even though I asked folks to keep them away from me, you tempt me with that shot of four lovely examples, lol.. I think I have the one that would go in the middle, an FC-76. What modules are those, Derek?. Happy views to all,. John.",0
"Unfortunately I won't be able to meet up with Sergio to peek through his FS-152 next month. It's probably a good thing, though. I'd probably think the views were wonderful but that I'd like a similar scope that's just a little bit smaller. The next thing you know, I'd end up buying a FS-128. So it's probably for the best. I still haven't had enough opportunity to enjoy the FS-102 that I bought in June, but that should change with the upcoming fall season..",0
"Modules? Do you mean you have the interchangeable newer FC 76? The ones in the photos are all old (fluorite uncoated) scopes, an FC-100N, FC-76, FC-60, and FC-50.. Derek.",0
"FC-100N........... DROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL. Though, I love my f/8 standard version",0
"Derek, sorry, that was a typo. I meant models. I thought that the top two in your picture looked larger than a 4"" and 3"".. I have one like the second from the top, an FC-76 made in 1990.. Cheers,. John.",0
"This is a very nice scope, super sharp. I am sure the 5 and 6"" doublets are nice as well. However, what I really want to look through is an FC-150, a 6"" f/11.3 doublet that apparently weighed as much as an FCT-150 and cost as much too!. Derek.",0
"just got a brand new TSA120 this week, and had a 5 minute first light through clouds. Have never seen an essentially perfect star test before.....I now have Takitis really bad, I need more Taks. If I go without food for a year I could get a Mewlon 250........... cheers. Gary.",0
"There is no cure, but Texas Nautical Repair can administer palliative care..",0
Much agreed Rob. They each have their attributes..,1
"Just a thought about Takitis,. I have come to believe in the Zen of Takahashi, a sort of Feng Shui where all the parts are in harmony as a system. After trying many aftermarket parts and third party mounts ( most of which are of very high quality), I keep returning to an all Takahashi system, mounts, scope, finder, eyepieces, even focusers as the most all around satisifying user experiance.. I am not saying that third party equipment dosen't have a place, for example a FT focuser to handle heavy bino viewers or a robotic mount for remote imaging, but on a whole Takahashi put a lot of careful thought into its designs and IMO, they just feel right!  YMMV. Rex.",1
"You know, there's meTECation for that. All you need do is consult APhysician. They'll write a very preZeiss prescription for your condition to cure what ails you. If you have trouble finding a Docter, send APM to me here in CN and I'll refer you to mine. I'll Televue, I have never felt better than after receiving treatment for this condition.  - Jim.",5
"Well, hmmmm. A FT??? Why on earth would one do that??? Don't need no ""steenkin'"" FT!. But those ugly green TAK mounts??? The mount needs to be white!!! As in the picture!",0
"Having this little guy at my disposal makes all others in the same aperture league (regardless of f-ratio) absolutely superfluous.. Thus, it has prevented me from ""consuming"" any other 4-inchers for the last 2 decades and therefore, at least for me, is definitely not a ""consumer's telescope""....Quite simply because it just doesn't make me want any other.. For me, this Tak is THE 4-incher I had always dreamt of, and not even an oil-spaced APQ-100/640, standing 3 meters from it for hours on end, could quite reach this air-spaced fluorite triplet optically, as even the APQ-owner freely admitted.... Chris",4

"I'm APt to not purchase any of those white mounts, I have given up gambling on the German Lotto. I prefer a dealer/manufacturer to have products in stock.  Rex.",0
">>>For me, this Tak is THE 4-incher I had always dreamt of, and not even an oil-spaced APQ-100/640, standing 3 meters from it for hours on end, could quite reach this air-spaced fluorite triplet optically, as even the APQ-owner freely admitted.... Chris - is it the FCT100? very cool!.",0
"Had the TSA-120 out the other day and was splitting Epsilon-Lyra with ease with my 3.5mm LVW (257X).. That's the highest power I could go with my eyepieces.. Also spent more time star testing (thanks Polaris!).. All I can say is that, to me, the star test is essentially perfect!.. identical difraction patterns inside/outside of focus.. Optics look very smooth as well..",2
"Cool. Thanks for the report, Rob!",0
"Oh, now I am so SOLIDLY GREEN with ENVY - an FCT-100 is my absolute DREAM! I would sell the lot just to have one. I had the pleasure of looking through one once - absolutely PERFECT - blew away all the AP's, TECs and APM's there at the time - undoubtedly THE best 4"" telescope ever made. EVER!. I made an offer to the owner. He ""kept it in mind"". Sadly, he died not long back, and his family had given the FCT away to one of his friends, and I cannot find out who.. One day I shall have one. One day... Maybe I could bribe Tak into making me one, for an extremelly large amount of yen of course.. Anyway... congratulations on THE refractor of refractors..",0
"See, now I forgot what I was going to say when I saw the FCT.... Oh yeah, placed an order for a TSA-102N today  I dislike sliding dew shields, so was specific about the N. The retailer has the S in stock, but I just can't do it....",0
"Lewis,. Just a suggestion, as a TSA102 with reducer is close to the Focal length of your FSQ85, perhaps you might consider using the FSQ85 at the shorter 500 mm focal length and just get a flattener for the TSA102 for the 816mm focal length. Gives you two focal lengths to shoot with.. Rex.",0
"Hi Lewis,. Maybe you're interested in some technical data on the FCT100:. Objective: 100mm f/6.4 => f.l. = 640mm. Airspaced NPN-triplet (CaF2 sandwiched between multicoated BK7 and K3). (FCT-design, still used for Tak’s 200 to 300mm observatory-class apo-refractors). Cool-down-time < 1 hour / 30F (=> usually, instrument is set up at dusk). Weight OF INSTRUMENT: 12.5 lb. including 7x50 finderscope, excluding clamshell, prism, exepiece.. Due to heavy 3.5-inch focuser with eyepiece-rotator scope is NOT nose-heavy at all.. Length: 29 inches from (non-retractable) dewcap to end of Baader 36mm Zeiss-prism). Instrument mounted on Takahashi EM-10 (motorized in both axes). Giant 3.5-inch 3-lens f/4.6 reducer/field-flattener for photographic WF-purposes (accessory). Eyepieces used:. TV - P.O. 22mm => 29x (for extended objects like Plejades). TV – N4-12.5mm => 53x (open clusters such as Double Cluster, M37, M46…). TV – D-8mm => 80x (globs like M3, 4, 5, 13, 22…). P – XO-5.1 => 125x (easy doubles like Albireo or Epsilon Lyrae; M1, M57; Jupiter in sub-average seeing). T – Hi-Ortho-4mm => 160x (Jupiter surface detail in decent seeing). T – Hi-Ortho-2.8 => 229x (Mars or Saturn in good seeing; close doubles like Eta Orionis). Transportation-box custom-made according to those formerly sold by Tak in Japan by local carpenter from 11mm plywood:. Now I send you my best congratulations for choosing the TSA-102. I'm sure thanks to its somewhat longer focal length it will play in the absolutely same league as the FCT.. If I lost mine, I would undoubtedly go the very same street as you are doing now.. Chris",0
"Hi Chris, Takahashi has redesigned the bigger brothers during the last decade. While ""old"" FCT (200, 250) still has central Fluorite element, the newer FET has a Fluorite and an ED element in the triplet (FET-200 and FET-300).. Imagine only during a second... a FET-100 (ED and Fluorite) anniversary model as they did anniversary units with FC/FS series. Unfortunately seems they will not produce an anniversary FCT.. Still all, you have a nice setup!!!",0
,2
That is just pornographic. Somebody get me some bromide tablets Sell me ONE?,0
Sorry but... What are the two outside scopes? The smaller ones...?.,0
"FC-76 and FS-60, maybe?.",0
"FCT-76 (early version) and FS-60, as far as I know..",0
"The red ribbon was exclusively used by Takahashi for their FCT-series.. => The upper one is the FCT-76 (f/6.4). That one seems to have a helical focuser.. As far as I know, no other FCTs than the 76 were (partially) available with helical focusers.. (There was also a series made with rack & pinion focusers.). Chris",0
Edif300...what a nice trio of FCT's!,0
apo porn!.,0
"Hi Iñaki, I think the Fluorite/ED-combination is only necessary for correcting the greater susceptibility of big apertures (200 - 300 mm compared to 100mm) to longitudinal and sphero-chromatism.. The FET300 is f/8 and therefore seems to need an even more complex (and expensive, of course) lens system.... Small FCT100s do not need an additional ED-element in their triplets. Since FCT100 already reaches polychromatic Strehl of 97% (in measured reality), an FET100 would be optical ""overkill"".. IMO, a hypothetical anniversary FCT-version would certainly suffice for perfection.. Chris",0
Nothing better than Takahashi porn..,0
Why they used a red ribbon only in FCT series? Also they used a gold ribbon in some units of the FC-60E..I never asked at Takahashi why and what the meant. Someone knows?.,0
maybe if enough takophiles called TNR Takahashi would consider it an anniversary model! I would love to see another FCT 100 125 150 or a novel 175 run ! These models seem to be even more rare than the AP telescopes as they rarely come up on astromart.. How many FCT100s are there ?.,0
"Iñaki,At the same time when the FCT-series appeared on the market, Canon were marking their photographic premium objectives with red rings.I think Takhahashi, getting their Fluorite-objectives from Canon-Optron, the same way intended toindicate the FCT-line representing their premium scopes.Danny,IMO there are not very many around worldwide. Most of them probably in Japan, because at the time of their introduction, Takahashi were still concentrating on the home-market. Main reason for them to have been sold in small quantities only, might have been their new price being twice the FC's taking them out of the focus of average ""consumers"".IMO, good FCTs only very seldomly appear on the used-market just for the same reason I wouldn't sell mine: Too good to sell! (Mine will probably be on offer not before I'll rip.)According to M.L., there also could be some lemmons around. Maybe these are the ones appearing most ""often"" on the used market? (Anyway IMO, what he says about scopes of competitory brands should be taken with a grain of salt.)Chris.",0
Thank you. That 60mm is awfully cute....,0
"Inaki your post on the topic of an anniversary FCT interested me enough to contact Texas Nautical Repair to ask about the possibility of such a run. Art said that the best way to go about this would be to email him, and he would pass the email onto Takahashi Japan. I suppose that they could gauge whether such a run could be feasible, and then think about producing it if it made financial sense ? Anyhow if enough people emailed them with an interest in an FCT special run maybe they could do it ? Art said it would be pretty expensive since their FCT series was a labor of ""love"" and no expenses spared.. I think I'll email them with an interest in an FCT. ( any size ) Anyone with me ?. btw the last time they did an FCT 150 run, it was planned for 20 pieces and ended up being 17.",1
"Last year I asked about it in Japan. They answered that there weren't a project about anniversary FCT model in Takahashi.. I don't know how is the situation now, but I think that the 80th anniversary has gone..",0
"Still, The legend is alive..",0
The FSQ-106ED is better astrograph than the FCT-100 with dedicated SR at f4.6. But the FCT-100 is better telescope than the FSQ is.. A good compromise would be something like a TOA-110 f6.5 (with still available 67FF and a redesigned of now discontinued 645SR). I think would be as good fast visual telescope as the FCT-100 is and would be a better astrograph than the FCT-100 is for CCD.. Maybe this would be more attractive to manufacture by Takahashi..,0
Thinking about prices on the lately FC doublet anniversary.. I could imagine A new anniversary FCT would be the total cure of takitis,0
I'm very happy with my new baby!,1
Nice!. My Mother of your baby (1988 FC-100).,0
An original FC-100/800 is a gem. Congrats!.,0
,0
"Chris, I have neither! Well theres a third option for chickens like me.. I imagine lot of takitis infected people may sell some of their older models when/if an anniversary FCT should emerge. Well I guess I'm not going to be completely cured either",0
"Inaki, was Canon making the lenses for this series at the time? When I first saw a picture of an FCT with the red line I immediately thought of those old FD manual lenses, with only a few having the ""L"" designation and with that highly visible differentiator, that red line near the front edge. Of course, when the new EOS lenses were introduced, Canon updated and expanded the ""L"" line and kept the red designator.. Perhaps Takahashi followed the same tradition to separate the FCT models from the FC models. Only a guess.. By the way, would it be possible for you to delete that picture with the trio of FCT, um, porn as it has been referred to? I think that it is not helping those of us afflicted with the Takitis symptoms. Let's see, FS, then maybe a TOA, oh, the FC are nice. Ah, the Mewlons too. Now FCT! Does this ever end?. Cheers,. John.",0
"Oooh...look at this! FS-60CB/Q Pretty pricey, but fun to look at nonetheless.",0
"Very funny Scott. I admit to this small group that I am suffering from this affliction and you tempt me? Ha, ha, ha, ha!. Too late, I got the same set up from someone here on CN a few months ago. So there!. Cheers and may there be many Taks in your future,  John.",0
Why am I even looking at that kind of stuff when I've already got a Tak scheduled for delivery later today!?!,0
"Agreed. Mine was one of the last ones produced, and actually has the interior fluorite objective coated (most of the original FC-100s had an uncoated fluorite interior lens). Its performance on planets is incredible...it is generally the scope used whenever I need the quickest cool down and the ""cleanest"" overall high power visual planetary image..",0
,0
Very interesting. How does your FC-100 compare with your AP Traveler in terms of optical quality?.,0
"I may be in the early stages of Takitis...For any owners of the TOA-150, is the scope that far out of balance the the 11# cradle weight is required, and if so can it be removed and placed on the scope after placing in the mount? I don't have a permanent set up but set up for two to three days at a time, but hoisting 32+ pounds would be a hell of a lot easier than 43+.....",0
"You can use the TOA without the tube c.w. But you may have to slide it back aways to balance it. Also it kind of depends on the weight of accessories you put on the focuser end too. I use a large finder and usually a binoviewer so this helps to offset the heavy front end somewhat.. The tube c.w.can be attached anytime. I usually leave the tube rings open and then lift the 33 pound OTA into them, lightly clamp and attach accessories then balance..",0
"Hi! I actually like the Tak better. I find there is just slightly better contrast and color saturation on the planets, with less scatter. Part of this may be due to the minimal scattering characteristics of the fluorite crystal, or the simpler, air-spaced design. But I am strictly a visual observer, and there is a smidgen of false color at very high powers on bright objects. The AP Traveler has a bit less false color, but the high power images don't appear quite as ""etched"". Additionally, cool-down time for the Tak is much less, so it ends up being my default telescope more often than not.. But, I do like the portability and wide field views the Traveler offers..",0
"I posted about this rather recently.. Yes, I DO have the TOA-150.. Naked, without dovetail, rings or tube weight, it is an ungainly 30lb ""bag of hammers"" with all the weight up front by the optics.. With rings, dovetail plate and tube weight, it is 50 lbs plus!. Mounting it either way is no joy!. I use the ""girly-man"" method depicted in the youtube video: https://www.youtube....h?v=IwVg1M6bURI. The tube weight goes on last, after the TOA is mounted.. I use a rolling tool cabinet and wooden box to hold the bare OTA assembly at the correct height.. Works for me, and it's pretty easy and not ""scary."" Dropping a TOA is not something on my bucket list..",0
"Two of my Taks, FCT-65 & FC-100.",1
"Thank you for this clear and comprehensible characterization! I am a visual observer, too. My Tak 100 D, which weighs only 2800 grams (OTA), will compete against my TV 76 as a grab and go telescope..",0
I'll vouch for that!,0
"You didn't? If you did, I think you will find it to be far, far more impressive than your former FS-60! I owned two 128s, and they provided STUNNING planetary images, a definite step up from the 102. But, it is an unwieldy scope (although light)..",0
"After almost sending the ""I'll take it"" message to the seller on AM that has a TSA-102 for sale a couple of times, and after talking myself out of it.... I keep looking to see if it has sold. Now there's a second one up for sale.. I think such behavior is a sign of acute Takitis. Fortunately, I have some diversions like family and work that pull me away from this silly behavior.. There, I feel better now Cheers,. John.",0
"John, I don't even want either of those two TSA-102s, since I couldn't be happier with my FS-102. Still, I can't tell you how many times I went back to look at those ads. I tell you...it's a disease!",1
"Yes it is! And it can be very dangerous to your bank account! I have way too many refractors now, yet I always look at the Tak ads. I wish I was 20-30 years younger when I was in shape to lift a TOA-150. <sigh> Cheers,. Ron.",1
"Ron, I obviously don't know what financial situation you're in, so this isn't directed at you, but I'm writing this as a response to the comment that you made. I've decided that one of the cruel ironies of life is that when we were younger men, 20-30 years ago, many of us weren't in any sort of financial situation to afford nice gear like this. And then years later when our financial situation may have become a little more stable, we then find that we don't have the physical strength, energy, etc. to actually use the gear that we could have really enjoyed using, had we been able to afford it way back then!

Is the TSA 102 (being a triplet lens design) much heavier than the FS-102 doublet?. Bill.,0
"Focuser is the same, main tube is the same as an FS102 NSV, the objective is a about 1 - 1.5 LB heavier.. Its a very fine scope, for planetary, has better color on planet details than an FS but slightly less contrast on nebula like M42. Thats what I found doing side by side shoot outs with both of them. YMMV. Rex.",0
"Hi Guys.  How's this, a good friend of mine came to me for advice on purchasing a good telescope. I said how much money have you got to spare, he said money was not an issue up to a point. I recommended a TOA 130. He used it for a while, came back to me and said it hurts my neck when I use it near the zenith and could I make an adjustable pier. I said I have just the answer, a Linak adjustable up and down tower.I constructed the unit and it worked a treat,he was happy. Then one day he came to me and said I am buying a caravan and heading around Australia and the TOA is to heavy with all the gear needed to support it to take with me so could I look after it for him.He said I can use it as much as I like. Well once I had a good look through this magnificent instrument I court TakitisI was a bit nervy about using this as it was not mine,so I went and bought a TSA 102S, and now I have Takitis real bad. He rang me one day and asked me if I was using the scope, I said every now and then, he said you might as well make good use of it because I don't no when I will be back if ever.He said if I am in the area I will ring you and come and have a look.

This is the Cure for Extreme Cases of Takitis !! :-). http://www.takahashi.../en/FET-300.php.,1

"Okay, I know this isn't a refractor, but the ""Takitis"" thread still seemed like the most appropriate place to put this, since this is where all the Tak aficionados hang out. Have any of you ever seen one of these before?. Takahashi Teegul-100 - link 1. Takahashi Teegul-100 - link 2.",0
"Scott,. It is a Dilworth Cassegrain. Tak also offered a big 300/2280 f/7.6 Dilworth in the early 90ies.. Thanks to their corrector system after (!) the focal plane these were able to combine quite short focal ratio and quite a small secondary with directly being suited to providing an upright image.. At least in Europe, they offered the bigger Dilworth also under the Name ""Mewlon"", parallel to the first DK-Mewlons, but then stopped it and went on with the DK-Mewlon-design only (for some technical difficulties with the Dilworth-system they seemed to have had...). The small Dilworth under the Name Teegull which you posted a link to above was meant for terrestrial mainly,. Chris",1
"Thanks, Chris. I'll have to do some reading about the Dilworth Cassegrain, as I had never heard about this particular variant before.. Sorry everyone for the off-topic (i.e., non-refractor) post, but I figured someone here was likely to know something about this model scope.",0

"My guess is that it is for straight through viewing where there is no diagonal to counter balance the objective.. It would seem that the TOA150 is about 32-33 lb as a bare ota ( as reported by some reviewers ) this is only about 5-6 lb heavier than an AP 155 or 160 with 4"" focuser at 27 lb. So as I have never heard anyone calling either AP scope "" HEAVY"", I wonder why all the "" so heavy"" remarks about the TOA 150 for 5-6 lb more? It is ( IMO ) a small difference in weight between them for such a large scope/ mount system.. If I were younger, the TOA 150 would be my dream scope, ( and still is, in my dreams ).. Rex.",1
"The cruel irony of life for most of us is that when we were younger, we couldn't afford such nice things. And now that we're older, even if we could afford such things, we're not able to handle them easily. But I've learned to adapt. This is why I'm perfectly content to own multiple small refractors instead of one large one.",1
"So true! And to put things in closer size perspective - my TOA-130 had the same tube diameter as DoctorDub's FS-152. The TOA-150 is almost a full inch bigger in diameter (155mm to 179mm)!. But while I am dreaming, it is nice to know that I could possibly use the TOA-150 without the Accessory Ring. It looks like Dr. Who's front ring is right up against the dew shield stop and I could live with that.. Now I just have to dream up the extra funds plus the healthy back to cover this fantasy. Cheers,. Ron.",0
Cheers Jonathan. I do very nearly that very thing. I have the Nexus DSC and tie it wirelessly into SkySafari. How are you mounting that Android on there? Being able to do that would be perfect!.,0
You can move the OTA forward in the mount so it's easier to view at zenith. It doesn't look like it on the mount but that is a large and long tube..,1

"Takitis is chronic.. I tried - unsuccessfully - to break the addiction by purchasing the Stellarvue. All it did was HEIGHTEN the Tak addiction..

That is brilliant mate!.,0
Thank you Rex. I've seen that. And I think that's a good method. I may end up trying that if I get an EQ mount for visual. The way I mount it per above works fine and isn't a strain. It's the dead weight of it as I carry it from storage to mount. Unless I get a trolly or a Sherpa that isn't going to change.,0
Yeah... I just bought a FS-60CV. Sigh. No reason other than it was less than the Stellarvue 60mm. Now all I need is an FSQ-85 and TSA-102 and I will have covered the range.,0

"1992 Classic FC-76 with red ""F"". EM-1S with wood tripod.",6
"HiLike to share my experience with the new FC-100DF and Binotron. Compared it with Orion ED100 & Stellavue SVRT90R, the ED at X243 showed little less detail and less sharpness vs the FC. The SV was overall darker at 90mm. Sharpness was better than ED though. Eyepieces used were pairs of Pentax XF 8.5 and Delite 7mm.Here is my experience with planetary in SW Florida over several nights:Jupiter at X243: More details than ED & SV due to higher contrast and sharpness. Jupiter is low in the sky now and the red spot is less visible.Saturn: Just overall sharper and cleaner picture. Delite 7mm at X243 were great but there was a little more detail in XF 8.5's at X200. Even tried X340 one night, but lost sharpness and some details.Moon: Amazing sharpness up to X340 (Delite 5mm).Paired it with Manfrotto MT057C3-G and DM4, dampening time due to tripod at high mag at X243 is 2-4 sec. Now I'm thinking if I should add the TSA 120 for even better views, but much higher cost & weight. Are the views of the FC comparable to the TSA 120 or even Vixen 115s, or is the difference hard to detect in LP skies?Overall the excellent views and light weight are a level up form my previous scopes. Hope the mini review was enjoyable and I'd be happy for any suggestions.Attached a pic of my new ""lifetime"" scope.Clear skies - Pete.",4
"Hi Pete,.  Nice review. What mount is that in the pic?.",0
The TSA 120 will deliver obviously but not overwhelmingly more on every object. The TSA 120 is not so much larger than the 100 as to be impacted by average seeing.. The optic in the TSA 120 is fantastically sharp and color free.. The TSA 120 will take more time to acclimate but not all that much more (it’s only 120mm). The TSA (at 13 pounds bare OTA) should be fine on your DM4 (18 pound load capacity) but you will probably need a sturdier tripod.. I had a 102mm apo and moved to the TSA 120 6 years ago and would do the same today.. Bob.,0
I think it's a DM4..,0
Checked with Diskmounts a few months ago and the DM4 can handle the TSA120 according to Tom Peters..,1
"Alright good people from the land of Takahashi... Just throwing something out there to get a consensus. I recently purchased a wonderful FS-78 short version. So far the views have been super sweet and I am loving it. However, there is a nice Sky 90II currently on amart for sale and I kinda want it. I had a Sky 90II a little while back which I sold but I still greatly miss. If you were I, would you go for the Sky 90II? I know they get a bad rap but the one I had was a great performer and I think that it had a lot to do with the fact that I used a prism diagonal instead of a mirror. Also, I purchased the FS-78 for a pretty decent price and I would have to sell it in order to finance the Sky 90II which I think it is a bit overpriced for a Sky 90II. Any comments and suggestions would be appreciated. Takitis is not an easy condition to deal with. LOL..",0

"My Sky 90. It survived a 1200 mile trip from the seller to me and remained in perfect collimation.. It's not quite the perfect little scope, but I REALLY REALLY REALLY like it. I can't push the power without colour dancing (I limit it to a 12mm EP), but the image integrity is still there (just colourful  ). I viewed Venus and Jupiter the other night down in the heat haze riddled horizon, and I could still readily see Jovian banding, even using a 24mm EP.. All it needs is either the Tak reduction unit for the focuser, or the FT Micropinion (preferred, as it also protects the all-too easily bent chrome plated brass Tak pinion shaft).

It is amazingly compact compared to the classic FS-102s. Of course the optics are top notch. Stars are pin pricks on a black velvet background.. I would be happy with a FS102, an older FC100, or the new FC100.  Years ago I owned an FC-100, with the battleship gray paint scheme. I actually liked its performance better than the FS-102 I had at the time.. Of course I sold it to pursue other windmills.  I tried to find another classic FC-100 but, no luck.  Hence, I decided to buy the new one when it came out.. I tried to get the FC-100DL instead of the DF but, am glad I got the DF.

"Agreed!. I often think that the only scope that could possibly ever make me want to ""trade up"" from my FS-102 might be a gently used TSA-102 at a nice price. But every time I think that, I start asking myself ""why?"". For visual use the FS-102 is about as optically perfect as I could ever expect or want a 4"" refractor to be. And I don't do AP. So I'm not sure what I would gain from the TSA-102. If only I could rent one for a couple of weeks to find out.",1

The guide scope/alternate imager is an FS-60C mounted on a Takahashi Altazimuth Camera Platform. The mount is an EM-10 with the Temma2 Jr conversion. The mounting plate is something I picked up at NEAF in 2015. I believe it's normally used on a Tak PM-1 mount. It's a bit less convenient than the adjustable saddle arrangements, but I wanted to keep the whole thing at or below the weight limit of the mount..",12
Looks nice! How'd you find a new tube for it?.,0
It was published in a national star party in Japan last weekend and someone posted the pictures. It will be formally announced by Tak in September..,3
Larry. That is a beautiful set up. Wow!. Best Regards...Tom.,0
"Oh, okay--I misunderstood. I thought you were saying that you had a damaged Mewlon 180 and you replaced the tube. Even better!",0
If I can do that maybe I can apply for a job in Tak!.,1
Looks like the rear cell/finder scope color is no longer the Tak green..but a light blue? Why no RACI finder scope?. Bill.,0
"Basically nothing will be green going forward, even a counter-weight, unless it's from dealer's exiting stock..",0
""" I've looked at clouds from both sides now...... "". First light will have to wait a little longer",11
"I went to the Doctor and after several tests, the diagnosis was Takitis Obtainiensis...... He told me to take 2 Taks and get some rest........ Nexus Now fitted to the TOA/T-Rex and working beautifully......",12
The little 180 is back?  Arrgh! Hide the credit card!. Ron.,0
How much $$ will the new Tak 180 be? is it about an f/12 system like the Mewlon 210?  I thought that Takahashi was going to a black color scheme like the DL focuser has. Bill.,0
"List price JPY 179,000. Yes it's f12. The new color is light blue (between blue and green)..",0
Couldn't take it any more. Regretted selling my FS102NSV (but circumstances forced my hand). I ordered the Takahashi FC-100DF from Anacortes today and Gary was kind enough to honor the old price. Only drawback is the 3 week wait (but I am #1 in line). I figure that the container ship with my scope is somewhere about 350 nautical miles west of Midway Island right about now.,6
Congratulations! It's a great little scope.,0
I don't know for sure but maybe the black colour is just for the limited editions..,0
Mmmmm I note the labels say Mewlon 180C.......so a corrected version :-). Looks like a cooling fan on the back cover as well...... I wonder if it has electric secondary focuser ??.,0
Uhhhhh this is something I dreamt of when starting astronomy years ago..,0
"I wish it had a cooling fan. I think that what you're seeing is just the Mewlon label, as my former M210 had a label that looked just like that..",0
"My imaging rig I brought to Central Australia: Tak Sky90, EM11USD3 (Non-Goto), D810A, Gitzo Systemic Tripod Series 3.. Results of the trip:http://www.cloudynig... 16 48 40.jpeg].",10
Another image of the setup:.,17
Beautiful shot..,0
"I plan on using it with a RACI finder, a 1-1/4"" diagonal and mostly TV Radian EPs. Will the FC100DF work in that config. on a mount like an ES Twilight I?. What about a decent go-to mount that won't break the bank?.",0
Tak Mewlon 180C is announced. http://www.takahashi...mewlon180c.html.,1
"Pretty! Maybe I need to give a Mewlon a try again, especially if this one will be significantly less expensive than the 210 that I used to own. I wonder what the price in U.S. $ will be..",0
"That is one of those ""why?"" scopes. The 210 is really nice why make a 180?.",2
"I use a 24 Panoptic as a finder with a Tak 1.25 prism. You will probably have to use a shorter extension tube than the one supplied with the scope, I went ahead and orderd the Tak eyepiece turret extension tube because I would like to get the turret at some point.",0
"Yeah, you're probably right. But if the 180 is substantially less expensive then I could see that as being the big draw. If the 210 is only a few hundred dollars more, then I'd just as soon go for the 210. I can't imagine the 180 being much more portable..",0
M210 vs M180C. weight 8.1 kg vs 6.2 kg. length 700 mm vs 625 mm. diameter 244 mm vs 210 mm. And Tak said the coating is improved on 180c. See the diagram below - the red line is the new reflection rate and the blue one is the old..,2
"Thanks for the data, Redondo.",0
refractor-like:. µ180/ µ210.,6
M180 and M210?.,0
"I like the new finder bracket, kind of molded and alien-looking. Looks like the secondary supports are nice and thin.  Would be nice aperture compared to small refractors for grab-n-go    Does it say anything about permanent collimation in there?   That would sell me",0
"The 180c has a 6x30 finder vs. a 7x50 finder on the prior version. The 7x50 finder (without bradket) in the U.S. costs about $175 more than the 6x30 finder so that's one area where Tak presumably was able to keep down the cost for the 180c. Having used both finders, I'd rate the 7x50 as world class. The 6x30 not so much..",0
Classic FC-76 on classic quarter hitch.,10
"Gorgeous FC76, the first 3"" that thought it was a 4""",1
Yep many people said that,0
"And the FS60 must be the 2"" that thought it is a 4"" !.",0
"Does that mean that my 4"" DL thinks it is a 6""?",1
"Nope. It means that all 6"" telescopes are afraid of your 4""",0
"Well, It seems I've come down with the scourge myself. Best problem ever! I just received my first newly purchased Takahashi. Earlier this year I bought myself a slightly used TSA-120 that was my very first telescope purchase. It has been a wonderful experience getting to know the night sky with such a wonderful instrument. This summer however, I went to see my dad in Vermont, and wasn't able to bring along the 120 for somewhat obvious reasons. I did bring along my 10x50 Swarovski binoculars, and as wonderful as they are for viewing the night sky, there is something to be said for a nice scope on a mount. Anyway, I really wanted something that I could cary onto an airplane to compliment the 120. After hours of digging, I settled on a FC-76DS...of course there weren't any used to be found, so I called my local dealer who informed me that there weren't any in the country, but he did happen to have the FC-76DC in stock...Naturally I just can't do things the easy way, and so I had to wait nearly three months for one to be sent over by slow boat.I must say, I am thrilled I waited. This thing is gorgeous and just Perfect for what I wanted from a size standpoint.. A couple notes that will only be of interest to those of us that frequent this forum. This is a new 2016 model, and so is among the first to make it to our shores with the new Takahashi Blue color scheme. I've done my best to capture that difference by laying it next to my TSA-120. Also, they appear to have changed how they assign serial numbers. Previous, at least to my understanding, you alway knew what year your scope was made because the serial number started with the year of manufacture. My TSA-120 starts 14xxx for example...well this scope starts out...8Cxxx. Anyone have any further insight into this change? Lastly, you will all be relieved to know that Takahashi takes their Warranty very seriously, to wit; Theirs is no ordinary warranty, theirs is called a ""Wamrranty"", says so right on the certificate of inspection. Also ALL of the electrical components of the scope are warrantied for no less than 1 year! fantastic! Huge relief for me. I imagine that the Muffler bearings, and blinker fluid are included in that as well.. So, the only hitch with the color change, is that the tube clamp, and finder scope bracket sent, are, of course, the old color. And, while I know it is of no real consequence, I am really hoping I can get them swapped for the correct new color.. First light soon!!.",6
More Photos....,3
Can't seem to get more than one photo at at time to load....,3

Just beautiful!.,0
"I like your optics! 4 nice refractors with the Swaros in there. The new Tak color seems nice…it's so close to the old one, I'm thinking ""why"", but it's their call, maybe they just got sick of the green color. I can see the advantage of the 76DS - it shrinks down into a small package for air travel.  The DC is skinnier but longer. I love the choice of 2 different models. Bring on the FC-76DL!.",0
"I wonder if Takahashi will make accessories to match the scopes light blue focuser's?  I own a DL and would like a black Tak clamshell ring to match the black focuser, but doubt that will happen.  It looks kind of weird with a green Tak clamshell and a black focuser.. Bill.",0
"I've just receive an email from my dealer indicating that TNR has some on order, but....doesn't know what color they will be?! It has got to be tough being the distributor for Takahashi. I get the sense there is a lot lost in translation. Anyway, they are happy to swap the items I received out for the correct color...assuming that is what shows up in 4-6 weeks....I'll update this thread when I know more.. Michael.",0
Very nice--congrats!,0
Hi Scott. Think this will be the FC-76 DL The FC-76 DCU at F 126 number 15 out of the 30 units made,6
"ooooh, fs128 on CN classifieds......",0
"Y'know, they make a topical cream for that.... - Jim.",0
"I got through to the seller and looks like I'll be purchasing it.. I was a little worried that it may have been a scam being that the seller is a newer member with 0 posts and doesn't take PayPal.. I did talk to him on the phone and all seems well.. If these FS 128's are as good as owners are saying, this may be the one that takes me all the way to the end (of my days).",2
"nice pickup!!!! one quick way to check for a scam is to ask for additional pictures.  You could ask for a lens close-up, and/or focuser, and see if he can produce one..",1
"The ad doesn't seem to be listed in the Classifieds section any longer, assuming you're talking about the one that was listed earlier today..",0
"Yes..That is the one. I did ask for and get photos showing the lens, focuser with serial # and what looks to be a feather touch micro added. The Super Polaris is included. Yes...I'm a little nervous.",0
"hmm...seller banned from CN, buyer beware.",0
Member no longer active...Does that mean banned?. No money sent..... Strange........Did anyone else get through to the seller?.,0
"Uh-oh. A few months ago there was a bogus AP 178 f/9 ad, someone almost sent money, there are real scams going on here..",0
Obviously a scam. A photo sent is proof. The scope is supposedly in Texas but the wall outlets shown in photo are the type used in Europe,1
I replied to his ad with a few questions very soon after the ad was posted but never received a reply..,0
you did call seller? what was serial number of fs128?.,0
Serial # 07025,0
"interesting - the 178mm ad was also based in Europe and the photos gave it away, you could plainly see an Italian streetscape in the background, I think they claimed to be Ohio. Could be the same scammer.  Probably lifting photos off a European classified website..",0
"I always ask for a photo of the item in question, with either their business card, or a hand written note with something I've specifically asked to be written on it. You could also ask for a photo with today's paper in it (proof of life of sorts)....but nobody reads news papers anymore!. at least this way I know they actually have the item in question...now, as to them actually sending it to me, I'm always nervous too.. Michael.",0
"My understanding is that Takahashi stopped producing the FS series scopes, except for the FS-60, in 2005. The serial number of the scope in question seems to indicate a production date in 2007. Either my understanding regarding the production date is incorrect or something doesn't add up..",1
You're absolutely correct. I don't believe that there are any FS-128s with a 07xxx serial number..,0
I suppose it could be a crooked 1 instead of a seven. I have the photos but the moderators won't allow me to post them in the thread.,0
"If you can host the photos somewhere else, you can provide a link to them. Just an idea..",0
"Wow. I guess that is why I have always preferred to buy used scopes from Astromart. Never had an issue there. Never had to ask for ""proof of existence""..",0
"For me a very mild form of Takitis started with an FS60C, and later a TOA-130NS, seen here at a recent visit to a dark sky location.. My baby Tak is wanting to ride onboard but I haven't figured out a good mounting solution yet....",7
I asked the doctor what I could take. His prescription....,10
"Of course its not a cure, it just treats the symptoms.",1
"Very nice little setup..... Sure to give decent views too. (but don't underestimate the disease, a single FS102 is going to dull the ache for a while but you will need bigger medicine eventually).",0
This is actually my 2nd FS102. Sold my first one 8 years ago and regretted it ever since.. Ultimately I plan on piggybacking it to my CPC1100 just for fun. A rise in fever (larger Tak) will likely be in my future but my symptoms should be quelled for at least a little while. ;-),0
"My Takitis flares up very now and then. The treatment isn't cheap, as it usually requires the purchase of something off AM or CN. Sergio (crazyqban) came to my rescue with my last bout a few days ago by supplying me with a small adapter for my FS-60Q. Fortunately that was just a mild flare-up of the condition. The more serious exacerbations often require the purchase of an entire scope. Apparently fluorite has some pretty potent medicinal qualities.",6
ALERT!!! FS-152NSV on sale at Astromart. Maybe I should get it and make a bino scope. LOL.,2
"For some unfathomable reason my wife said that I am not allowed to by the FS152......... It seems unfair, after all, I did redecorate the lounge room today:.",9
Matt- I had to sit down and breathe deeply for a minute to stop from passing out!  That is a beautiful picture! As soon as the rings come in I will post the 210 and 250 as well as the 120 and 85 in similar repose.. What ADM saddle do you have on the right side? I want to replace the stock saddles but am not sure which to get...,1
"I think my wife would also pass out if she knew how much all this stuff costs !!!. We (Phil & me) have been doing a bit of a comparison recently firstly the TOA150 v TSA120 & TSA102S, then Mewlon300 v Kunama18""F5.6 on DSOs and just the other day we had the TOA150 v TOA130 battle.. The saddle is the ADM DUAL-EQ6 with puck. I am actually looking at a pair of Altair-Astro Heavy Duty saddles in the near future..",0
"Hi Matt. sqrt(102*150)= 123.7 => TSA 120should beslightly belowthe middle of the two others performancewise (same optical quality provided).... I wonder if this wasthe caseorif it appeared to be better or worse than ""in the middle""?. Chris.",0
"I saw that. I've actually looked through that particular scope at a star party, and it's a good one. The seller had it (plus the EM400 mount that he's also got for sale) with him at the last star party that I attended a few weeks ago. So what keeps me from buying it? Just the price. Sadly, that's all. If I bought the scope, I'd probably want the EM400 as well.",1
"I was feelin' so bad,I asked my family doctor just what I had,I said, ""Doctor, (Doctor )Mr. M.D., (Doctor )Now can you tell me, tell me, tell me,What's ailin' me?"" (Doctor ). He said, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)Yes indeed, all you really need,Is….",7
I'm talking to himabout buyingthe rings. I like them better than the tube holder. Hopefully I can pull it off..,1
"brian, please update photo with counterweight. i get nitemares thinking about unbalanced gem..",0
I see that someone bought it. That lucky person is going to get a really nice scope!,1
Wish I had the funds.  Waaaaaah!.,0
"Chris, the TSA120 was probably a little less than the middle ground. A subsequent comparison of the TOA130 to the TOA150 puts the 130 noticeably closer to the 150 than the 120 was.. As far a visual quality goes, all the four scopes are visually perfect..... the TSAs cool a bit quicker than the TOAs.. Next time we will set up all four in a row........ In the meantime, Carson's question above prompted me to look more closely at the ADM saddle and, after a few minutes pondering, off came the saddle for a little bit of attention.. The sharp edges and corners that are feature of the ADM saddle have always bothered me so out with a file, emery paper and Autosol Paste and after an hour here is what I found under the anodising:. ""Long Live Obsessive Compulsions.. "".",6
"This being a Takitis thread and all (meaning all things Tak), can I ask for a bit of help?. I'd like to remove the lens assembly from my FC76DC to clean the assebbly from the OTA side (need to use a blower - manual one of course - to make some dust disappear).. Removing the dew shield is simply an exercise in unscrewing it. How about the lens assembly? How does one remove it? This will be my first time doing this and I am a bit apprehensive about it",0
"If there are no screw heads visible then the lens cell is probably threaded onto the tube and needs to be unscrewed right?. btw, I've been using this compressed air for years with no problems, it's never sprayed anything onto the glass, I'm always sure to hold the can level:. https://www.chemtron...px?r=1&m=2&id=1.",1
Matt-. Thanks! Can you mount the ADM on both sides or only one side? I am not a fan of the itty bitty saddles that come with the mount.  And I like what you did to the saddle! I noticed in your other post that you said you balanced in EQ mode first with CW on and then switched to AZ mode. Do you balance each scope in EQ mode on the main saddle then leave the CW in place and add the extra saddle with the second scope? Or some other method?. Nick-. It is likely threaded. So you will want to unscrew it. Shoot an email over to or call Takahashi EU and ask them. They would be able to tell you for sure.,1
That is just so beautiful! What more could anyone want? But I guess that's a silly question on this thread. Mike.,1
"The ADM can be used on either end, I will look for another so I can have matching ones. To get the balance right, I set the mount up with the head at 35º then worked out the balance for the TOA and marked the amount of extension of the c/w bar and position of the weights with a felt tip pen. I then installed the secondary saddle and the TSA102s and rebalanced the rig and marked those positions.. I then changed the mount into Alt Az config, so now depending whether I use one scope or both, I have all the positions already marked. Getting the balance close in EQ mode means the bearings are not side loaded inAlt Az mode. These are the only two scope setups I will use on this mount so, unless a new scope comes along, the mount will now stay in the AltAz configuration.....",0

With the Extender-Q that's made for it (and the Sky 90), that increases the focal length from 530 to 850mm, it does quite well for my limited range of targets in my light polluted back yard.. Haven't done it yet but I'd bet at a location like Mt Pinos, the views at it's native focal length (or with the extender) should be memorable, seeing permitting.. Cheers,. John.",0

I still haven't had a chance to use it yet, but am really looking forward to trying this out with my f/10 Tak FS-60Q. I've got a lot of stuff (non-astro) to do before Christmas, but hopefully I can get some viewing in the following week when I'll be off work.",0
"You're welcome, Scott! It feels good selling off some of my excess gear. Trouble is that it's easier to buy than it is to sell. I keep telling myself that if I buy used Taks (this is a Takitis thread, no?), I can always get most if not all of my money back later when I sell, shipping notwithstanding. I've been lucky in that I've never been burned by anyone on CN or AM. That's a statement on the kinds of people who are into this hobby.. So I sold the diagonal and that was to help pay off the FS-102NSV that I just picked up.  Does this ever end?. Cheers,. John.",4
"John, have you had any more opportunities to enjoy the FS-102NSV lately?.",0
No worries John! There is always next month! And I will see if I can get WesC to join us and bring some of his wife's magical hot chocolate with butter she makes for him!,1

There was a gentleman with a Tak FS-152 and EM-400 who would usually show up at the semi-annual regional star party in Virginia, but he just sold off all of his Tak gear about a month ago. And no, I didn't buy it, as it was too pricey for me. But I'm a little bummed that I won't get to look through and at it any more.",0

"Allan, I have not done a direct comparison of the two yet. I'm going on astronomy trip this April with friends. If I pick up another mount by then I will definitely do some side by side comparing. Here's what I do know from my own experience much of which falls right in line with what most would expect..... I've only had the FS-152 for about six months but it has blown my socks off unlike any scope I've owned before. It is just consistently awesome and has taken my excitement for observing to a whole new level.. Chris.",8
"I have had mine for two years now, and it continues to amaze me. I can only suggest that you get a ADC (atmospheric dispersion corrector) such as a ZWO for observing the planets below 60 degrees.. CS. Jonathan.",0
A FS-128 just landed in Shanghai..,13
"You're going to fall in love with the FS-128 Takahashi, Redondo. I have the series from 102 mm - 152 mm. I cannot find a better lineup in this size range for a visual-only observer.. Best,Randy.",2
Thanks Randy. I'm sure I will and I'll be keep looking for a FS-152 (even better if it's a NSV version)..,0
"Very nice, Redondo! Hope you like your new FS-128 as much as I like mine.",0
"Here's a night view of my FS-128 on a Vixen New Atlux mount. I think the FS series are awesome telescopes, particularly for visual observers (I do not do AP). You have a great refractor in my book, Redondo.. Regards,. Randy.",7
"Well, the Sky 90 went bye-bye  but I replaced it with the FS-102 I restored a year or so ago. Glad to have it back.. 1999 (appropriate- Space 1999  ) FS102 (maybe I should call it Eagle 1?). CAA. Flattener/reducer. 7x50 illuminated finder. BTTech QD finder base. Using Vixen 115mm rings slightly refelted to hold better (works better than the Tak clamshell). Now rides on a Sphinx mount, as sadly, my VERY much beloved GPD2 went with the Sky 90. I actually had a lump in my throat seeing that sweet, supremely accurate mount go. Ahem..",3
Indoor test..,8
On FTX..,13
Wow! That's terrific!.,0
Lewis--glad to hear you've got your FS-102 back! Howard--nice FS-102 pics!,1
Thanks. That's actually a FS-128. Glad to know it looks small!.,0
"Ah...I should have known, especially since I own one too. In that case, nice FS-128 pics!.",0
My brand new FC-100DF!.,14
"Seeing the FS 128, between the FS 128 and a TSA 120, what's your pick and why ? :-).",0
Both are great scopes. It's the difference between doublet and triplet. TSA has better correction and is smaller. FS is cooling fast and has more aperture. To me I like old Taks so I prefer FS-128. If I have either of them I don't think I'll go for the other one..,2
Carson have you tried the 250 yet?. Bruce.,0
Bruce-. I got a brief first light with it. I posted about it in my Mewlon 250 thread in Cats & Casses. I figured best not to post here since it wasn't a refractor. Here is a link to the first light report:. http://www.cloudynig...-250/?p=7613134. As soon as Daniel has his new Star Party up and going out in TO I will bring it and the TEC 140 out as well as the AP 155..,2
My FS-102 on my Vixen SXW out on the upper balcony catching the setting of Venus tonight.. Blue and white everywhere,8
"Lewis,. A beauty - which I hope does not get re-homed again in favor of something else!. Lost loves are hard to get back, you got lucky!.",1
"Well, I once saw a TSA-102S in my future, then my wife intervened - play money denied...so the FS-102 snuck in the back door came back home  Happy to have it back too - after Venus set behind the apartments over the road, I turned to M45 - a lovely vista in the 30mm Ultrascopic that even the wife thrilled at. Nebulosity was very apparent, despite being in an ultra-red zone (seeing is VERY steady and transparent tonight, despite the lingering 93F heat at 9pm). I swear I saw green in M42 the other night too - not the usual grey but definite green.. Alas, my last night for a while - packing it all in foam and boxes tomorrow in preparation for an interstate relocation..",4
"My 13-year old FS102 and Nicknacknock's much younger FC76, posing together after a relaxed evening of casual observing right next to the waves of the Mediterranean Sea....",16
"A relaxed evening indeed. M42, M43, M46, M47, M103, Caroline's Rose, Thor's Helmet, Christmas Tree Cluster, Rosette Nebula, NGC 2169 - the ""37"" cluster, NGC 2362, Pleiades, Venus, Mars. A very pleasant 2 hours The FC76 never fails to impress me as it punches above its aperture due to truly superior contrast! The FS102 is in a league of its own though. Larger than life indeed. The FS Series is most impressive!.",7
"Under good skies, like I imagine you have on Cyprus, those fluorite doublets impress like no other scope their size..",3
"Erik,. Fairly decent I would say. Four observing spots about an hour's drive away, with SQM in the 21.2 region, plus a couple of other spots with 21.6 but it's like a 3 hour drive to get there. It's all going south though, bit by bit, courtesy of light pollution....",0
Light pollution,1
Here is an old advertisement from Sky and Telescope magazine..,16
"Those twins are magnificent!. On a smaller scale, in my quest to mount my FS60 on my TOA-130 I recently addeda green Takaccessory ring with the added benefit of balancing the tube higher.. At least that the ongoing and as yet unachieved plan...""Its not easy being green"" especially with the blues around....",8
"Here is my 2008 model TSA 102, 2014 model FC76 DC and the new Mewlon 180C which arrived yesterday!.",20
"Nice trio Andy, let us know how the Mewlon goes..",1
Mewlon has the new blue look. I would be interested to hear how it compares to your TSA..,0
"OOOOOOHHHHHH, the Mewlon 180...I have a temptation brewing.. No, got too many other **** expenses moving the enchilada, fixing a broken GPD.....",0
TSA-102 on FTX v2 and Tak SE-M tripod..,7
Lewis... Lewis... Why are you fighting it? You are just going to end up tired. You know she is calling to you. Just do it...,0
"mini winter tak party 2017 @ dixon, IL. dusted off cobwebs after a cloudy january.. nice views of venus and jove.. checked out comet 45p visiting hockey stick and whale.. shooting galaxy ""fish"" in virgo barrel.. hope to meet other tak owners at next go around..",7
Would anyone here be able to tell me the shipping dimensions of the original box for an FC-100D* please?. I wonder if it would go along as checked baggage on a (friend's) flight back from Japan..,0
It's 106cm x 40cm x 29cm,1
"My newly ordered OTA rings from LB Astro at Italy finally arrived. Actually pretty quick. They are a pair of sexy red rings for the Takahashi FS-152 (should also fit TOA-130). Takahashi's original tube rings are good, but their M-8 thread size at bottom more than 4"" apart force me to use a heavier than necessary, fat and relatively short dovetail plate, which I don't like. Now I can use the standard D type longer dovetail plate..",8
They look great! It will be even better if they can paint it in tak green lol.,1
I LIKE THE RED' VERY SHARP LOOKING. My favorite rings were the WO white rings they do not sell any more. I had a pair of 114mm white rings for my Tak tsa 102 once' Should have never sold them..,0
Takitis... always needs decent prescription....,6
"So is this like rabies, but less painful?.",0
"Yes, less painful but more expensive....",1
"Painful? No. Expensive? Maybe yes. Worth it??? ABSOLUTELY.... The only problem is, where do we (ever) stop???.",6
I finally get to own an FSQ - the BabyQ. One of the shops had this used for a great deal and snapped it up 2 days back. I just took delivery of it less than 2 hrs ago. A few nicks here and there but the lens is clean :-.,7
"Nice catch! Great looking Baby Q!. As far as ""Takitis"" goes, I only have a heavy ""fever"".. that does have me looking at all of the sweet Takahashi choices out there. I'm purely visual in my astronomical pursuits (Astronomical League club lists), so I'm leaning very much towards the FC100DC or the FC76DC. And one day, one day....",0
"Cheers. I was lucky with this as it really was a steal. If this appeared in Yahoo Auction, it'll go for a lot more. So it was amazing how a shop would be selling for less than the demand prices offered in an auction. The 100's appears every now and then too. I hope to use this Baby Q as a travel scope for visual/astrophotography. I've got a tracker but doubt if it'll take the Baby Q..",0
"I am in Hell!Arrived this week, a bright and shiny, very clean, 20yo,FS102. First thing I noticed was the weight. Significantly lighter than any other 4"" I've owned. Second, the OG. Absolutely clean and grunge-free. Third, the views. Oh Lord! The only other scope I've owned that had this sharpness and contrast was a mega-bucks AP 155. Even at almost 300x on Luna, through some nasty air, everything was perfect.So why am I in Hell?Well, I thought this was going to be my 'lifer' telescope. Just settle back and enjoy. But now...If the FS102 is this good, how much better will an FS128 be? Roughly the same optical quality I would think, but stuff would be bigger, show more detail, hit you in the eye with that extra 26mm of glassy goodness! A typically good FS128 is more than double the price. I could swing it. Steal from the mortgage, raid the pension, hit a Shylock. All of which would put me in ill odour with 'er indoors. So you lot that own FS128s, please tell me I'm not missing anything (much). Let me sleep!.",1
"I have both a FS-102 and a FS-128. The color correction is slightly better with the 102 (but that's just physics, as they have different aperture but essentially the same focal ratio, f/8 for the 102 and f/8.1 for the 128). The 128 is obviously heavier and longer, but is still one of the lightest 5"" apos you'll find. Both have quality fluorite optics, and since they're both doublets, they both cool down quite rapidly. But the 5"" optics of the 128 are noticeably brighter and give better resolution for planetary detail. Both are excellent scopes, and I feel that I'm quite lucky to have superb examples of both. I go back and forth trying to decide which of the two is my favorite scope. If I'm planning to be outdoors for an extended session, such as if I'm attending a star party, the FS-128 is my scope of choice. If I'm just going outdoors for a short time, I'll frequently choose the smaller FS-102. If I could only own one scope period, I'd have to pick the smaller FS-102, as it would likely get more use than if my only scope were a 5"" apo. But as I said, I'm happy to have both, and plan to keep them both for quite a long time.",3
Selfish man!!! You've had your turn. GIVE me your 128. Give it to me now!,1
"My little FCs: FC 50, 60 and 76..",14

"Stop?. Cheers,. John.",0
"Congratulations! And glad that you got a great deal. Enjoy!. Cheers,. John.",0
My quest to mount my FS60 on my TOA-130NSusing a green Tak accessory ring is mostly complete. I ended up using a A-P QRBASE with the existing holes enlarged. I think I like what I've done although at times it appears a tad crowded around the eyepieces. I'm still evaluating this configuration and next need to figure out placement of the TeleVue Starbeam red dot finder..,9
"Hello everybody,. here is my pocket taka scope",14
"Yeah, I know the feeling. My FS-102 is a lifer. I wish I had also bought the one you got  At least I got SOME of it, and his LE30 EP I put the LE30 in the other day to align the 7x50 finder. I aimed it at a golf course marker some 600 yards away - about the max clear distance I have here. Looked in the scope and POW! PIFF! KAPOW! (yes, really like a classic Batman episode!) - the image punches you in the face almost like it's 3D, and SO bright, contrasty and sharp! I literally said ""Holy SH**!"" (the differences between this Tak LE30 and the TV 40 Plossl I usually use was astonishing).. I then used it that night at a mate's DARK sky site.... the images etch themselves on your retina  I was seeing FAINT galaxies quite well (5 in one field), Jupiter was astonishing, Omega Centauri was resolved into SOME individual pin points (ok, not like the friend's Mewlon 300, but at 3x the diameter, and almost twice the focal length, you'd expect that  ), the Omega Nebula stood out plainly without averted vision.... The 102 is just a WOW scope..",1
"Glad to know your enjoyingmy LE.  Actually I was dithering a little about getting one. I have a 24Pan that goes very nicely indeed and was wondering wether the 30 would be overkill, but more is more, so we 'll just have to go without meat this month.. Dunno if you've tried one, but can highly recommend the 7.5 HiLE - as sharp an EP as I've used ans just perfect for lunar obs as it takes a Barlow like a champ. You're only limited by seeing here.. All in all, I'm extremely pleased with the scope, particularly as I've had two duff Taks before (both TSAs). I'm getting no image breakdown and the view at the EP is one of the best I've seen, regardless of aperture.",0
"A very neat and tidy setup.. What would improve it would be a larger case with space for a 1.25"" diagonal and a Pan 24, a Nagler 13mm T6 and a Nagler 3.6mm zoom.",3
you're in trouble now....you probably should have started with an FS60 or FS78 and you might as well wait for an FS152 at this point..,2
**** Vaccinations are useless against the new virulent strain of Takitis Obtainiencis****. Having finally recovered from my last bout of Takitisand having been 'clean' for exactly one year I let my guard down. I got carelessand while celebratingexactly one year to the day since collecting my TOA130NFB last year for the Tak Attack Star PartyI let my guard downtoday and browsed the Takahashi website. long story a little shorter.......  I am now awaiting the arrival of my new Tak FOA-60 refractor which should be a nice finderscope for the TOA.,7
And yet here you were trying to talk me out of my order on the FOA60 last week. You just want to be the first in Australia...but ya gotta wait til June now,0
"You two are incorrigible!!!. Just make sure the required number of photos are taken and posted here please, along with a long commentary on performance etc....",2
Congrats Matt!! I saw the FOA60 box in Kyoei on Wed and it's actually rather compact which makes it a nice portable size!. Looking forward to your thoughts on it when it arrives!,0
"I'm still thinking to get an FSQ-85 AGAIN.... Sean, want to trade for my FS-102 when you come to Tak Attack?",0
"Australian delivery date is in June, just in time for my 60th birthday so maybe I can get my wife to pay for it......",1
beautiful spring weekend for city outreach to help endure Takitis..... having grs in view around opposition was a treat!.,9

My FC-76 DCU set up at F 12.6.,5
Very nice set up.. Glen..,0
TSA 120 AT 130 you have an excellent pair of scopes. I had a AT 115 and it was good. I looked through a bigger TAC I liked that a lot. You can't hardly go wrong in the scopes you have. Well I will enjoy my AT when it gets here. Getting a TS maybe if I find a nice sum of cash someday... Anyway enjoy those scopes they are awesome..,0
Maybe **** Vaccinations are useless against the new virulent strain of Takitis Obtainiencis**** But at least they cut down the virulence of the infection..,1
"Getting a Handle on the TOA130NFB:. My little DIY from yesterday's efforts..... Using 10mm thick aluminium angle I made two end brackets that attach to the TOA rings using four M6x20 s/s cap-screws.. Between the brackets is a 110mm x 20mm Ø aluminium bar that has been drilled and tapped each end to take M8x30 cap screws.. The bar was sleeved with 20mm ID carbon fibre tube which was glued to the aluminium bar.. Before assembly the end brackets were treated to some 180,400,600,1200 wet&dry before being polished with lots of AutoSol paste and 'elbow grease'.",20
Good job with that handle Matt!! Beautiful and classy!!.,1

Very nice.,1
Very nice!.,1
"Matt, you're always putting a smile on my face..",1
+1.,1
"OK, so I might have a touch of OCD........ I gave the dovetail plate a bit of a cleanup today....... it sort of matches the handle now:.",6
"I always wondered if Tak spelled Apochromat properly on the TOA's (unlike how they spelled it in grand-failure style ""apocromat"" on the TSA-120) - now I know yes - you'd hope so for the price paid for one",0
"I'd bet you wouldn't say NO to one with the wrong spelling though!. I've a friend who owns a FC100DL with DEMO written on the serial plate, and FC100DC written on the lens cell. Even so, you'd have a hard job prising it out of his dead fingers.. Mike.",0
"Come on Matt, we've talked about this, it's CDO ok..",0
"Matt,. That's just plain pornographic. Giving me unnatural thoughts.. Well done..",0
can't cure takitis....why not spread it....,9
"The delay in getting the FOA-60 out of Takahashi Factory to me has given me an opportunity to get some bits together to mount the FOA onto:. Manfrotto MT055CXPro3 carbon tripod. Skywatcher Star Adventurer Wedge in red. Takahashi Sky Patrol III mount in Eq mode. and today's little DIY job, the Kunama V series 5"" Dovetail plate, you guessed it... in polished aluminium.... P.S. I just realised it is not a case of OCD, it is far more serious than that...",8
"Nice! Aluminum? No way! A bar of pure silver, repurposed! Looks great!.",1
"Matt, it must be nice to be retired and have all this time to pander to your OCD..",0
"Great work as always Matt! Would be interesting to see that FOA-60 on the SPII.Got a question to ask you, do you think the SPII can handle an FSQ85ED for astrophotography? I'm still hunting for a portable/travel friendly setup for the FS85ED..",0
"With all my hobbies, I don't really know how I had time to ever go to work at all Allan. Thanks Sean, I have yet to try out the SP, it certainly is beautifully made. I think much will depend on how well you balance everything.. Bring your little FSQ to Allan's place for Tak Attack III later this year (October or November new moon).",1
Nicely done on that Star Party I am sure if I get another opportunity to look through a Tak I will have Takitis too......,0

another great clear comfortable night to expose folks to takitis.....,11
"Great pics! Is that your FS 128? It's huuuge! I was pondering trying to source one next year, but I doubt my manservant could lift it let alone set it up. Good help etc. etc..",0
The FS-128 despite being physically large is surprisingly lightweight and easy to handle..,3
I completely agree with what Sergio said above. And I'm someone who really doesn't like manhandling large scopes in the dark..,2
"Yup, same here. The FS128 is a large scope but of low weight for its size and thus easy to move around..",1
"didn't have good chance to compare views as we were busy manning the scopes for outreach. during private session experience, the refractor provides great sharp images right off the bat. the cassegrains started at low power; after acclimation in 1-2 hrs, able to push image to nice impressive scale especially on jove bands, saturn rings and lunar crater diving. a lotta of ohhs, ahhs from folks......",2

"Very professional!. Did you make the ""tilt-saddle"" as well (for aligning the telescopes)?. Mike.",0

How does it ride on that twilight mount?.,1
"My objective was suffering after some dew settled on it and then some dust and pollen decided to have a party in the dew spots......... SO....... a little session with some Baader Wonder and a spit polish was in order, a few tissues and lint free cloths later I could see the glass again. I was in such a hurry that I forgot the 'before' shot but the 'after' picture is much more to my liking anyway.",11
The good thing is you don't have to wait 10 years for Tak Spit to brew... it's available now,0
Best thing since sliced bread...... works wonders on stubborn spots..... I knew all that spit polishing in the Army would come in handy one day (only took 41years..).,0

Superb mounts...can we get them in the UK?.,0
"wow, looks like very nice machining work!   are you taking orders???.",0
When is the Website (or at least a Price List) going up!. Mike.,0
Well I'm happy to report I'm once again a proud member of the Tak community. I've been watching AM for 6 months waiting for one of these to be listed!.,18
"Whooo Nelly! Very nice, congrats..",1
Not all that well as it turned out. I upgraded to a DM-4 and a Berlebach Uni tripod. MUCH better!. Mike.,1
"Dang, that needs to be in every Tak lovers arsenal! congrats.",1
"Well, it looks like I'll be the new casualty of this affliction. I've just purchased a Sky 90 from s very nice fellow on AM. I've done quite a bit of reading on this particular scope and understand that it's not to everyone's liking, though as I'm looking for a compact ota for travel and grab and go, and it will be my first experience with Takahashi, I decided to give it a shot. I'll get some pics up once I get it. I'm sure I'll have plenty of time for photo sessions as this will guarantee a week of clouds.... A question for you guys, what would be a good alt/az mount for a travel setup? I have a UA dwarf star on siriu legs but it may be a bit light. What are your thoughts?. Thanks very much!.",2
Congrats on the Sky 90. I have one (Sky 90II) and I really like it. Yeah it has some optical compromises but overall I am very satisfied with the images it puts up and I love the compactness of it. I think that you will enjoy yours.,0
Thanks Sergio! From your description I'm guessing you use your DM6 with your Sky90II?.,0
I have heard from several owners of the Tak Sky 90 that the extender Q will noticeably improve the scopes visual performance by increasing the focal length and reducing CA. But it is a very pricey accessory.. Bill.,0
"Yes. It's overkill but I am trying to keep things simple hence, just one mount..",0
"Sergio, I've looked at the DM4 and am considering it.. Bill, I have a lead on an extender Q so it may be the next accessory that I purchase.. Thanks to you both!.",0

"Very nice! I like your mount Is that an FS-78?. Cheers,. John.",1
"Yes, it´s the little FS - such a sweet scope! had a FC-76DS before but never liked the sliding dew-cap... and the FS scopes have that nice blue ring around their lenses - great! Next to that I always wanted a complete Tak setup including scope, mount and one of that nice darkbrown, wooden tripods with the big metal fittings.. Well the optics is first class of course too",1
"Just bought another FS-128... gave the objective a bit of a clean and am very pleased. This is the one that was for sale on the general for sale (not the 'log in' S&S), with the Scopegaurd case, FT pinion,and all accy's, a heck of a good deal! Russell if you read this thanks again!. It is 4 years older than the one I'veowned (it's a 1998 serial number) for years but possibly in better shape.. One of these will get passed down in family so we'll both be using the same scope,I really love the FS-128.I had to sacrifice the FC-100DF that I bought last year but hope at some point to have funds to replace it or get the f/9 variant.. Yes, I used the Tak USA cleaning fluid, PecPad / Kimwipes for the light cleaning.. here's the glass image. and here is the focuser mod... looks new?!.",14

"I think we all know that ""Takitis"" is a real disease and there is no cure. Over the years, I have been infected at least seven times and now I have caught it again. Oh well... I can't say I am sorry, nor do I plan to seek a cure.. Here is my latest affliction:. I would like to thank Howard Gao for letting me take one of his three (!)FS-128s off his hands.  This is my second FS-128. It isin immaculate condition and it works just as goodas it looks!. First Light was last night under excellent sky conditions. I played ""sky tourist"" and had a lot of fun cruising my favorites. It is great to once again have a lighter weight doublet that can compare favorably with my much heavier triplets. I wanted this scope to use on those nights when I cannot physically handle the bigger scopes and this one looks like a keeper. Cheers,. Ron.",17
"Beautiful ""new"" Tak, Ron!",1
It's my pleasure to sell this wonderful scope to you Ron. I'm really happy that it goes to a good home. Thanks and enjoy it!.,2
"Matt, I've worked out why your gear always looks so good, you take nice photos of it. There must be an astrophotographer inside you busting to get out..",1
"Congrats on the new 128 Tak, Ron. Wish the I could take a look through it! I am enjoying my 100DC.. Bill.",1
It's all done with mirrors !!! I gave astrophotography when TechPan 2415 went out of fashion......,1
"Bill,. Thanks! I have seriously considered getting one of those new Tak fluorite scopes, but the only thing as bad as ""Takitis"" is ""Five-Inch Fever"". Ron.",0
Interesting report on the FS128 done by W.Rohr in Germany with respect to the Strehl values in the different color spectrums. Not saying all 128s are at this level but I'm sure they each have a high degree of correction. What's interesting most to me is that the scope tested was serial number #04028; mine is #04027. I'll keep my fingers crossed that mine is pretty good also.. Link > https://translate.go...er-farbreinheit.,1
"I have now owned eight Takahashi refractors - including two FS-128 - and I have neverbeen disappointed in any of theiroptics. I think ""Pretty Good"" is an understatementwith these scopes. Thanks for the link!. Ron.",2
"Yeah, I've only owned 6, also with 2 128's in the mix... quality is not something I loose sleep over... this new to me 128 I've spent the last few nights with - just an amazing scope, every bit as good as the other that is in it's case at present., they are vintage 98' and 02'..",2
add binoviewers for luna surfing.....,16
Excellent setup. I have the SP3 mount as well but not the SW wedge; how do you have it mounted with the rail? Does that come with the wedge?.,0
1 part tak + 1 wo bino + dash of cool clear skies = lunatics in the making...for kids and young at heart.,8

"Daniel, what model Tak are you holding in the photo? Alan.",1
"I would be alright with that as my man cave, probably be divorced though, hee hee.. Nice collection Daniel..",1
"That would be FS-102NSV.. Daniel, nice collection.",1
Thanks StarDust1..,0

Now that is what we call a Takaholic!.,1
"Not exactly a refractor, but definitely Takitis!.",12
"I like the focuser on your FS-102NSV.. Nice collection you have there.. Cheers,. John.",1
That's all Wayne at Starlight. Wonderful person..,3
"It is a very nice setup. I made the dovetail bar from some 12mm x 50mm aluminium bar to suit the little Tak.. As nice as the setup is, I may actually end up doubling up the FOA as a companion/finder for the TEC which has a 3100mm focal length.. In the meantime (and with apologies to my mate Phil who was too indecisive about putting in an offer ) I made an offer on a nice Pelican 1740 case and its contents.. In the end I relented and agreed to sell the Pelican case to Phil for his TOA150. I will be keeping the contents, pictured below, for myself much to Phil's chagrin.",0
"Yes, Takitis is still an affliction I cannot rid myself of:. The FOA makes for one fine finderscope...... I installed a Sky90 CAA after painting it black.. To make it fit I had to chuck both of the FOA visual back components in the lathe and machine then down to accept the CAA.. The FOA60 now sports the Baader T2 Maxbright mirror diagonal, K-Astec rings and DP75-250 plate.. The new arrival, a mint condition TSA120 sports the Feathertouch Micro Pinion Assembly, Baader CL-TAK2 visual back and Baader 2"" BBHS-Sitall Mirror diagonal.. Parallax rings and 14"" Losmandy D plate complete the setup..",9
"Matt,. Edit signature asap. I don't see no TSA120 in that signature.",2
"And Matt had to sell me his Tenba FS-128 case to afford the TSA  (Nick, wanna buy it? ). Fits the A-P Star 12ED, IF I take off the rings.. Here's my only Tak...part...on the Star12ED... adjusted the T2 shim so the CAA knob lines up with the AP focuser drawtube clutch knob.. And before Nick asks, that's a Baader Zeiss BBHS prism (T2/1.25"") diagonal I traded with Matt...he had it in his closet",2
"Nuts. All of us are nuts.. No thanks, must pause buying for a bit. Just got a 6"" Mak (lunar Imaging at some point) and receiving tomorrow a Borg 55FL and a Coronado 40mm Maxscope FYI there is a Geoptic case for Refractors - soft but well padded - with a length of 1,300mm. Fits my FS128 with room to spare..",1
"And just for giggles, this arrived today in the mail...AFTER Australia Post had returned it to Illinois without even trying to deliver it here...and then it ends up on my doorstep after USPS obviously laughed at our incompetence and sent it back here LOL. WARNING: the following picture comtains no Takahashi anything, so it can be viewed without fear of heart palpitation, apoplexia, catharsis or visual stimulus overload..",2
"Lewis,. I spy with my little eye.. something with a Southern Cross...",0
"Indeed, on the Site That Shall Not Be Named.. Making way for the EM-200 or SXP...decision pending..",1
"Keeping it simple this time Nick.... see below. Actually I just realised that my Takahashi dalliance has now gone the full circle........ It started with a pristine TSA120 then came FS60CB, Mewlon 210, FS60CSV, FS60Q, FS128, TOA130S, FSQ106ED, FC76DC, FC100DL, FS102, CN212, TSA102S, TOA130NFB, FOA60 and now we're back to the TSA120......might be time to stop and smell the roses...... And so that nobody can accuse me of being a Takahashi fanboy, I do still have the TEC 8"" MakCass...but I never met a Tak I didn't love !!!.",5
More like Tic-Tak-Toe.,0
"Matt,. How about a new topic with a looong post explaining pros and cons of each scope and why you moved from one to another and finally full circle?.",0
That'd take 16 pages of Matt speaking alone..,0
Takitis Chronicles!.,2
It's mainly very stealthy moving like a Finnish Adder slithering silently through the grass.,2
"Thank goodness for ""Doctor-Patient Confidentiality""! Otherwise, I would have to explain why I still want my old TOA 130 back - even though I have a TEC 140, TMB 130SS, and my Tak FS-128. Plus, I still cannot lift the doggone thing because of multiple spinal surgeries.. Takitis is a dangerous disease and it cannot be cured. You have been warned!!! Ron. PS - Beautiful setup, Matt  I also will not disclose why I have owned two TSA-120s..",3
That'd bekäärme.. Eerily close to KARMA,0
"I was lucky in that most of the Takitis was sponsored by the good folk at IceInSpace...... By buying only pristine examples of the various Takahashi models I found that I have recouped the investment each time i I sold one. Even those that I bought new were not sold at much of a loss just by timing the sales.. Why Takahashi? Despite all the groanings from the few people who had issues with their scopes, I have never had a problem with any aspect, optical or mechanical, of any of these Taks. They have each been simply superb examples of the optician's craft. It is hard to name a favourite, a bit like asking someone ""which is your favourite child?"". The scopes that gave me the most memorable views were the TOA130S on Saturn and the unbelievable CN212 on the M42 Trapezium stars.. Sure there are other great scope brands like AP, TEC & CFF, but when you're on a good thing stick to it.. Takitis Rules OK......",3
"If I recall correctly, it was you who told me to buy the TSA, in fact on several occasions.....I can't help it if the temptation was too much..... as it will be when you offer your TSA120 for my binoTak......",2
"Phil sell something? Yeahroit, fuggedaboudit!.",1
I need to find a cure.....,7
Oooooo. Dribbly!,2
"Well, my first Tak Attack (I should patent that phrase) came about 8 or 9 weeks ago with an FC100DF THAT IS AMAZINGLY contagious  Low and behold, on Thursday of last week a Mewlon 250 Tak Attack hit me again! Can't wait for it to get here and reinfect me. Perhaps a TOA130 next? Ugh. My goal is to eventually catch up to Daniel Mounsey before the disease kills me! Will post pics as soon as it comes in!.",2
"Sorry Michael but that Patent is already allocated and the phrase is copyrighted to Phil, Allan and me. The next TakAttack which is #3 will be held in November at Coolah, NSW, Australia...... By all means come to Australia in November for the new moon weekend......",1
"I am worried...i was dreaming that I was setting up a Mewlon last night but an FS152 was in the way. Main problem, I have neither!!!!.",0
People bragging about their new Taks are required to update their sigs AND post pictures within 24 hrs.,0
I am not bragging...yet....,0
Grrrr...no bragging until Sunday for me,1
"Waiting for my Mewlon to be shipped. I am DYING in anticipation! UGH!!! I have never seen a Mewlon 250 in person before. However, I have seen a Mewlon 210. The guy who had it attempted to sell it to me. He sold it before my wife approved the purchase. As soon as his sold, a 250 went for sale! Funny how things work out!.",0
I should have known somebody came up with the catchphrase!!!! Oh well.. There goes my million dollar idea!.,2
Yet.. There. Fixed that for you.,1
TSA with new carbon carrying handle and the little baby Takker.....,6
Looks suspiciously like my scope rings..........,1
I might be able to part with them......,0
Matt will part with them by trading him your TSA-120....,0
"OK, OK, enough.... here is my latest Tak - essentially brand new TSA-102S, straight out of the box, and with everything in the picture (except the EM-11).. And yes, the AP Star 12ED had to go to help pay for it.  But it didn't go very far and I get visiting rights..",8
"ill  - but however - congrats! the TSA maybe is the best 4"" apo ever made... But letting the AP go? - puhh, hard stuff - I belive I couldn´t have done that... on the other side... Tak, Tak, Tak...I can understand it cs. Chris.",0
"Yeah, I know, but the additional funds are going on a mount too...so.....",1
"Finally got my Tak FC100DF properly mounted on the Vixen GP-D in my back yard. My handyman securely bolted together four 6x6 pressure-treated posts and then sunk them 52"" into the ground. The adjustment levels are 1"" thick oak boards with 3 coats of outdoor poly. Happy to report that the scope does not vibrate at all.. Overmounted?!?!? No such thing. Thinking I could easily go with an FS-128NSV.",11
Another view....,5
Ok I think I'm more a Tak collector now....,13
"No excuses now Howard, time to build that FS128 Binoscope you need for your collection.....",2
That will be huge... I don't want to cut the tube....,0

"Lewis,. Nice to see you sporting the green colors again!.",1
The siren's lure was too strong..,0
"Yes,I certainly understand the lure of the Takahashi Sirens. Once you fall under their spell, you never fully recover.. Congrats on the new TSA-102!. Cheers,. Ron.",1
"How would the TSA 102 triplet compare to the newer FC100 DF/DL/DC doublets in terms of image sharpness and contrast? Would they all be too close to see a difference visually? I own a DC and while it is very good visually, wonder if a triplet of nearly the same aperture would improve the views a bit more and maybe show star colors a bit more vibrantly.. Bill.",0
"Bill - stay with your FC, use it happy and don´t think any more about it - any difference is really not worth at visual usage.. Nevertheless these Tak triplets have a magic that is hard to withstand... Starting with looking at them, handling them around and much more if looking through them. Maybe it´s just only the feeling that you have something ""very, very close to perfection"" while using these apos - hard to describe - and of course not logical - especially for visual only.. I tried for a long time too - but finally fell...   cs. Chris.",2
Me wants the Ortho 😁.,0
"I owned a TSA120, and now have an FC-100DF. I prefer the view through the FC-100DF.",0
"Bill, I found the FC100DL and TSA were so similar on most targets that it did not matter.. The TSA is very clinical in the way it presents a view, so sharp and once cooled it can be pushed easily past 200x.. Phil and I did side by side comparisons with the TSA102S, TSA120, TOA130NFB and TOA150,. there was no visible difference in colour correction or sharpness only brightness/resolution brought about by the aperture increase.. I think the TSA102S is the finest 4"" apochromat you will find..... I tried a few Taks and have settled on the TSA120/FOA60 combination (for NOW).",2
"Does the FOA acronym mean ""Finder On Apochromat""?. Seems so",3
"Lewis-. You, Howard, and Kunama make me want to sell my TEC 140 and AP 155 and replace them with a TOA 130, TOA 150, FC-76/60 combo, FSQ-106, and FC-100! That way I would have the FSQ-85, TSA-120, Mewlon 210, Mewlon 250, and the aforementioned. I had a TOA-150 but it was a beast so I replaced it with the 155 now you are making me think to go back.... All-. What is WRONG with me?!? Should I just give in? I could just about cover everything by selling those two non-Tak's except for the FSQ....",1
dr.. OMG!!! - critical case of Takitis!. Only cure:.,1
FOA-60 = Finnish Old Age -60th birthday   (Thank Phil for that...we were driving),0
Thank you Donadani! So that's a vote for sell and replace then?.,0
You all need professional help! And psychotropic drugs!!!.,0
"BTW, I got my FS-128 from Donadani (Chris)",0
I think the AP155 would be a keeper but maybe ditch the TEC140 in favour of the TOA130......,0
"Tell the Mafioso to Zip It and remind him that I have the keys to his observatory and am not afraid to use them, anyone want a cheap Moolon 300or maybe a TOA150.",1
"Matt,. Is that Moolon 300 something like Luis Vuttion bags or Prolex watches in Patpong in Thailand???",2
TOA150 please! As long as it's not a knockoff like that Moolon 300 out of Thailand...,0
"The TOA-150 is my cure for Takitis too - selling it would mean relapse in an age of delusion and madness So, sorry Doc - I have to keep it - just giving my FS-128 to Nick was a (too) tough lesson....",0
"Chris,. You are a hoarder! But I can understand why. The FS is an exceptional scope. Largest scope I am comfortable to handle without an obsy around and simply exceptional optics. So. Lesson of the day. Do not sell Taks. Just buy them!",1
"Are you brain-damaged?  The AP155 is IMHO the finest 6"" refractor ever made. The only thing you'll be gaining with a TOA 150 is ten extra kilos! The TEC 140 and TOA 130 are six of one, half a dozen of the other. Good God man, if you feel somehow deprived, get up, take a long walk breathing deeply, and get a grip.. If you really need a Tak, get one of the 4""ers and fuggedaboutit.. Better still, I'll swap you your 155 for my FS102. That'll cure what ails you!.",6
jepp! - well I just like to test this and that  - but right now I´m back consolidating a bit... (what does not mean selling a Tak!).,1
"Chris, in case you want to get rid of an FC-100D, contact me. You could get the right to visit it.",0
"It's OK....it's normal to experience occasional flare-ups of Takitis, even after one has moved on to another scope! You learn to deal with occasional pangs of anxiety and desperation.",1
"Hi Marcus - maybe I have to remind you:   You just have a FC-100D!    - why another one???. next to that - sorry, none here from that type... - my FC´s are about 30 years of age..",0
"AP delivered to new house, picked up NEW TSA-102S with MEF, CAA, QR finder base, finder, clamshell, offset plate, CA-35, and a lovely LE7.5 gifted to me with it.. Photos tomorrow, but going to sell the LE7.5..",2
"Lewis, no joy on the mount?.",0
"Arrgh! Doc,Takitis is a disease that cannot be cured and the flare-ups are bad. I sold my TEC 140 and replaced it with a TOA-130 in 2012. Then I had to have back surgery, so I relinquished the TOA. After I recovered, I went back to the TEC 140. As much as I loved that TOA, it is a tank and the extra aperture of the TEC helped me get over losing it.. You and I have talked about the TOA-150 before. I know for a fact that I could never lift it more than once and I amnot happyto admit that to myself. Once again, I think you can use that extra aperture of the A-P as a consolation prizeand simply enjoy the ""goodness"" you get from it.. Ibought anotherFS-128 to satisfy my latest bout of Takitis.. So justtake twoFSQ and call me in the morning. Ron.",1
Why another one? Look at this scope here: https://www.cloudyni...ion…/?p=7296441 The idea of building a binoscope does not let me go....,0
"Thanks for the helpful comments on the Tak 100 doublets vs. the TSA 102 triplet.  I really like that the DC I own only weighs 8 pounds including a the clamshell and Tak 1.25"" prism diagonal. Bill.",0
"I have a Vixen SXP on it's way. Owner made me a partial trade deal I could not refuse (wanted an SXP since they came out). EM-11 is nice, but painfully, PAINFULLY slow. As the owner said, slewing is 5 minutes horizon to horizon. So, if you had a set of targets for the night, you could have coffee in between each slew. SXP on the other hand, takes off like a rocket - in fact, the motor sound reminds me precisely of an EM400 (perhaps they use the same motors?). Slew rate on the SXP is impressive (watch AnakChan's videos of his with the Mewlon-250 on top and tell me you didn't wince thinking Sean was going to hit the windows lol)..",2
I remember my EM-200 was painfully slow as well. I would slew to a target and it would be on the other side of meridian I would question wether I wanted to go to it or not. Wonderful mount just slow as heck..,0
"Well I did play Rugby and was a Lock so the odds of me being brain damaged are pretty high... I just saw that collection of Tak's and became spellbound over it. The idea of a matched set of Tak's ranging from a 60mm all the way through to a 150mm was a serious draw.. In all seriousness I have used several AP 155's in addition to my own. I have also owned a TOA 150. I actually got the AP 155 because it was several kilo's lighter than the TOA 150. I did a direct comparison between my AP 155 and my TOA 150 before I sold it to pay for the AP 155. The TOA had superior color correction hands down. It wasn't by much but it was noticeable at the EP. Both in star testing and in regular viewing. My AP is very well color corrected but not to the level of the TOA. In addition I have seen a few less than optimal AP 155's.. Daniel Mounsey has also used several AP 155's and TOA's. He tested my AP as well. He had the same conclusion I did. Mine was very well corrected but did not beat a TOA.. Bottom line if you want the best color correction in the 6"" class of scope then the TOA is the scope to go with. Likely the same in the 5"" class as well with the TOA 130. But I don't have one of those... yet...",1
Cheers Ron. The TOA was the best corrected scope I have ever looked through. It was also the heaviest scope I have ever had to mount. It worked well on my DM6 and I could get it up on the Mach1 but it was not fun to do so. I just worry about the oil in the scopes and think back to that amazing color correction. Perhaps a FSQ-106 will take care of the problem. Or a nice G&G FC60 with the 76 conversion....,0
"I hear Takahashi are making a new OTA with an evolutionary (old dinosaur) design based on the FOA-60 ""Finnish Old Age -60th birthday"" exclusively for Matt.....the new OFA-60 ""Old Fart Apochromat - 60"".",0
Thanks for dropping it around today Matt. Might cut it up into T-Bone and Porterhouse.Look where the visual back is - kinda appropriate for this scope. Phil did say he was searching for black holes,6
"Here is ""Teaser"".. Decided I preferred the RARE 114mm rings to the clamshell so that is what is on there now.. Did some terrestrial checks, and so far, so GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD..",6
Woah! Wasn't aware of these rings... - I need them!.,1
"One of my favourite Asian dealers had them, still in the cardboard packaging with straps... brand new, and as far as I can tell, have not been made for 20 years.. Oddly he thought they were white and 115mm...nope, Tak green and 114 mm. Tak green felt...the works! Good luck finding a pair",0
"Chris,. Fess up. How many scopes currently in the collection?. I did see a couple of Astrotreff for sale - what, that brings you down to 38 refractors or so?.",0
"In a moment of Madness I have had a Mutant ""Tak"" scope spring up recently next to my TOA150. Don't worry though I still have a case of Takitis.......",10
only talking about the rings Seems you've eyes everywhere Nick... You're scary,0
"I had already forgotten how long the Star-12ED is until you just reminded me.The TSA-102 suits me MUCH more, since I am a porta-loo...errr-portable setup kinda observer/imager..",0

Hmmmm...highest bidder..... Shall we begin?,0
Send you the orig. clamp for them....,0
"I sold the original clamshell and offset foot that came with mine and kept the rings, so I doubt I need a clamshell back",0
"Finally ready to take the leap, and move up from my FS-128 to the 152. Might even consider the TOA-150, but I am a visual guy, and the additional weight and cost is difficult to justify.. Have to liquidate a pile of gear over the next few weeks.... 😶",2
"I think I lost a day or seven. Have you now disposed of your Star 12 and are back to Tak? It's confusing. You seem to go through scopes like I go through socks!. I was watching the images from Bangledesh and Texas last night, and it occured to me out of the blue, that what I really needis an FS128 or AP 130 f8..",1
"New scope, new mount...was time to refresh",0
The FS-152 won't disappoint you..,3
Assuming one is found. Very elusive scopes!.,2
"You don't have too. The FT 3"" focuser is really compact and shaves off an inch or two of the total length. It essentially converts a regular FS-128 into an FS-128NSV WITHOUT shortening the tube. If I recall correctly, that was my experience with my former FS-128..",0
Patience and an occasional wanted ad will eventually chase one out of hiding.,2
"Shhhhhhh !!! Sergio, I nearly had Howard convinced to send that 128 to me !!!!",2

"Great images moshen. I was imaging from Carbondale, Illinois and used Tak FSQ106N (most likely the only Tak on the field up there, though not sure), however seeing the scope CBS folks came by, the weatherman who was presenting from there is an amateur astronomer and knew about the scopes, as he finished up talking to me on camera he ended it with ""If you do not have a hitech and beautiful scope like a Takahashi...."". It was featured on CBS Chicago news in the afternoon.. Here are the images from the Tak. https://www.flickr.c...57685473433790/.",2
so paint the AZ/EQ-6 in Tak-green?.,0
"Thanks! I was camped on a ranch in Madras, Oregon..",1

You lot are weird,0
"Hi Piero, your pics are great! I did seem to get some very minor reflection in the diamond ring pic here:https://www.flickr.c...eposted-public/. You can judge for yourself on the reflection.. But not any reflections on the shorter exposure for Bailey beads..",0
Hi. Thanks for your response. Yours are incredible pictures. My challenge really were the high clouds... But I cannot think of a much better telescope than the FC-100 for the solar eclipse.. Piero.,0
Do any of you Takaholics have an old FSQ and have an interest in Russ' optical element described here:https://youtu.be/QkETkoS6Ys0I have a Denk II with a diagonal and Power Switch and that optical element (that I've removed from the diagonal) and I have no use for it and no ambition to ever own an FSQ.. edit: Free!.. and spoken for!.,1

I recently designed two adapters for the FOA60 draw tube to allow you to use the Takahashi Camera Angle Adjuster from the Sky90 and to allow the use of T2 components.I have tested them both on my FOA60 today and they fit perfectly.My adapters are now available for purchase from Rafael at RAF Camera.1. M47 x 0.75mm > M56 x 0.75mm2. M47 x 0.75mm > T2 (M42x0.75mm)Rafael sells them now for $24.95 each( Go to https://www.rafcamera.com/other and enter M47 in the search box upper right ),3

"Matt,. Planning to get this at some point sooner or later. The ability to use a clicklock on this or binoviewers directly mated to the scope is a big plus! Excellent work!.",1
"I wonder, can one fit the MEF-3 to the FOA 60? I assume it is possible....",0
"I haven't looked into that yet.... should be ok.. The M47>T2 adapter can be used to attach either the T2/1.25"" ClickLock or the 2"" Clicklock #2956242.",0

"I have some Orion scope bags going on ten years. Though my first FS-128 came with one, no idea how long it was used before i got it in 2009 or so. I've kept my TSA in one as well, that will get passed along to next owner. Used to be a company or two that would custom make a case for you,I did that with my TEC. Always consider first if you want to leave your finder and focuser end accy's attached and you'll be happy finding what you need to accommodate your habits..",1
"Cheers guys.. Thinking about a scope I can take with me and mount on a lightweight tripod for it. I want to keep it in the car occasionally when I know I am going to be some place for several hours at night with nothing to do. Kid is an athlete playing at a ""club""/""select"" level so practices are at night many times and I really do have nothing to do. I can go to a semi dark area of the field and setup for a quick bit of viewing and some outreach for other parents and brothers/sisters of the kids on the field.. Was first thinking about the NP101 but it only comes in the IS version and the case is pretty big. If I am going that big I might as well go Tak for a lower cost and keep the ""habit"" fed. Thinking about buying a Skywatcher AZ GTi from Europe or getting a Losmandy AZ8 with encoders.",0
"How about the 100DF doublet?, anamazing little performer..",1
Get two and send one to me! Ron.,0
"I recently bought this one. https://www.explores...earchparam=Case. for my TSA102 (space enought to a TSA120 upgrade ). very robust closures and handles.. I've tried a skywatcher one before but I had to return it, low and plastic quality.. you can see an example of the ES case with a TSA here, (see post #12 of Lew Chilton). https://www.cloudyni...se-for-tsa-120/. regards.",0
"How about a Sky 90 II? They can be had at a reasonable price and can offer a relatively wide view or high power with the Extender-q made for it or the original FSQ. And at something like 13.5"" long, will take up little space whether in a car or in a carry on for the overhead bin.. Cheers,. John.",0
Sorry I should have said that too. It is between a FC-100DF and a Tele Vue NP101.,0
Sure Ron. Which of your credit card's do you want me to use?,1
Cheers. I think Lew saw me doing that with my TSA-120. I used that case for mine. It worked well but it was big. My goal is something smaller.,1
Hadn't thought about that John. I thought there were problems with them...?,0
"Carson,. The Sky 90 Version I had problems with the lens cell maintaining collimation between the two elements. Version II fixed that.. Version II is available currently in Version III form (slightly redesigned cell) as the Borg 90FL. Made by Canon Optron (which makes Tak optics) and extremely lightweight and portable.. However, as a fast fluorite doublet, it has a touch of CA - just a touch mind you. So keep that in mind. Ted at Hutech can set you up. I had the 90 with a FTF and it was a joy to use.. It would ride perfectly on a strudy photographic tripod like the Sirui IR 5214 and a small alt/az head. If you need tracking and goto, it would ride well on the new SkyWatcher Alt/Az mount..",0
"dr.who, thave been a few threads on ""issues"" with mixed opinions here on CN but I'm very happy with mine. Maybe a hint of CA at f/5.6 with some objects but none with the extender-q as far as I can tell. And for high power use for planets in my light polluted backyard, I can push it and the images are great, seeing permitting. I find that a 3"" refractor like an FS-78 can""run out of light"" at high powers. Yes, the Sky 90 II is not as satisfying as an FS-102, but it's not nearly as large either. It actually can ride sufficiently well on a Sky Patrol II (for visual use) also if I want a super light tracking set up for ""travel"" or grab n go use. YMMV of course.. Cheers,. John.",0
There IS another option which is extremely compact and gets you to 107mm. The Borg 107FL. Still very compact and rides on lightweight mounts..,0
"I also have the Borg 90FL, with FTF, and I find the optics to be excellent. It is one of my two travel scopes, along with my little Tak and I generally travel with both. Since I do a lot of solar, I like to have two scopes up simultaneously; one for white light and one for Ha. Obviously CA means nothing on the sun, but even at night I rarely notice anything untoward. If we assume perfect correction for the FOA, a '10' (or as near as makes no difference), then the Borg is easily within the 9 to 9.5 range. Purely subjective on my part of course, but I've often been amazed at how good the Borg is. It compares favorably to my AP130 in many ways, especially when I'm carrying it any distance.. In case you can't tell, I recommend it highly. It particularly shines as a travel scope. It is a bit heavier than the FOA, but it collapses smaller and gathers more light. I think you'll find the views comparable (if not quite as good) to the FC-100 in a more portable package.. Michael.",0
"Cheers guys. I am sensitive to CA and it drives me to distraction so likely the Borg's are not a good option. I am locked in at this point on the FC-100DF. It is 26"" without the extension tubes on the back which is in spec for the case I am looking at. Unless there is a CA problem there too...? For a mount it is between the Skywatcher AZ-GTi and Vixen Polaris 2.",0
Do you guys have Geoptic bags in the USA?. This one would do....,0
I have an FC100DF mounted on a Skywatcher AZ-gti (I replaced the stock tripod with a carbon photo tripod for added stability). It's the best grab and go setup I've had (also have porta 2 and tv85). My most enjoyable viewing sessions have been with this combo under a dark sky.,0
If you're sensitive to CA why are you looking at doublets???.,0
"Congratulations. My experience with the FC-100DF was that it is an exceptional scope, worthy successor in the Tak line to the older 102 with added benefit of the fluorite lens not in front exposed to environment..",0
"hmm - yep - why no TSA-102? no color here... none, nada, zero, nixe",2
"Atmospheric dispersion must be a real bummer then, are you the person that also uses the ADC?.",0
"me? well for sure not ""the"" person  but yes - ""a"" person that uses an ADC but more often with the bigger scopes when magnification goes higher then 300x - was a good use on Jupiter and Saturn this season.. cs. Chris.",2
"Chris, thank you, Iremember following the post or thread on that (the ADC) and found it very interesting, added itto my 'someday' wish list..",1
I wasn't until someone pointed out in a PM that there was minimal CA with this scope. I am seeking consensus on that. Otherwise it's back to a NP101 or ES FCD-100,0
"Nothing compares to seeing for yourself, will be looking forward to your impressions..",0
get em while they're young.....,8
I would love to. Problem is finding someone with one and then finding time to meet with hem and use it.,0
Oh and he other reason why I am looking at a doublet is because it's a Tak!  I figure with this scope I will be one step closer to owning every Tak in the lineup. Do you get a toaster or set of steak knives from Takahashi if you own all of them?,1
I would think the more likely prize a divorce?.,1
"Some comments regarding false color and evaluating refractors and I'm on limited time. Most doublets and triplets with the exception of a very few particular ones will yield some false color out of focus. Spherochromatism is a common relation to refractors and this is a normal thing. If I evaluated a refractor and noticed some color, this isn't telling an experienced observer anything about how well the optical system performs on stars and planets other that someone is just saying they see some color. What is it specifically that the observer is seeing or not seeing on the surface of our neighboring worlds when the telescope is in focus? How is this interfereing or influencing the image? Is the color interfering with the surface contrast of particular features on planets? Is the observer just seeing some false color out of focus? Is it lateral color? Is it atmospheric dispersion? Many people parrot what they read in the forums, but very few if any share or discuss what surface details or contrast they are seeing on planets while ""in focus"". That's what really matters after you've evaluated the optics out of focus.. Let me give you an example. My friend J. Hawk just purchased a TEC140ED. Many observers talk about the newer Fluorite model because in theory, it's supposed to yield even better color correction. I told Hawk that even if Yuri called and said he would be willing to swap a Fluorite for his ED for free, I would say absolutely no, I'm keeping the ED. Why? Because the sample that Hawk has is so fantastic, he'd be a fool to risk any possible change in ""optical figure"" because it's that good. I've looked through at least a half a dozen samples of the 140's and this one is unquestionably the best I've ever seen. I do not know what the actual wavefront of the optic is and I don't even care. I just know from my own personal experiences using, testing and comparing these refractors that this sample is the best 140 I've ever seen. And by the way, these ED's exhibit just a tad bit of color out of focus. In focus, it's color free. It yields surface contrast on Jupiter like a high quality reflector twice its aperture.. Some of the finest lenses in the world may exhibit some false color. Photography picks up any false color out of focus, see the link below, but the dynamic range of the eye is different. Remember that color is just one possible aberration of many that may or may not degrade contrast. I've seen refractors that are completely color free in and out of focus that yield horrible contrast on planets because the exhibit too much spherical aberration or don't have a smooth figure. My FS152NSV has some very minor false color, yet it yields spine tingling surface contrast on planets and could easily match or surpass most triplets in its aperture class. It has a world class optical figure and the optics are extremely smooth. This is what observers should be paying attention to, not whether or not a scope has FPL53 for example.. http://aberrator.ast...actor_80_5.html. Here are the red flags. Too much concern over glass types, yet no regard, respect or discusssions regarding ""optical figure"". If I'm evaluating a telescope Derek Wong has, I go into it completely open minded, not even knowing what type of glasses or design it may be. Just set this up and let me look through it. Certainly I may be curious sometimes, but that's not even close to drawing a conclusive result. Let me see what kind of image it can produce. What I see too much of in the refractor forums are too many inexperienced observers with too many preconcieved notions. Take dust for example. Imagine sendiing back a telescope just because of a few specs of dust. I've seen this happen many times. Dust is nothing more than something that we breath in, everyday. What's far worse is excessive spherical aberration. You could be sending back a completely excellent optic just because of some dust in exchange for something with more spherical aberration or perhaps the other way around, but at least take a look at what you possibly might have. You've blown an opportunity to evaluate an optic and that's a huge red flag on the observer. Speaking of false color, people should read this.. http://www.csun.edu/...land/color.html. There are so many factors that influence an image. Another good thing RC explained was the importance of optical mating elements. People get so caught up in one particular piece of glass, they ignore everything else. It's the same thing with diagonals. All people care about is whether or not it's 99% dielectric, yet have absolutely no regard or concern that the surface quality may be compromised. Some of the figures on these diagonals are horrible and people spend all this money on a great refractor and buy a cheap dielectric diagonal just because its apparently 99% dielectric. People should be spending more time observing with these scopes instead of worrying about does it have this, does it have that. These are all nice scopes and the degree that people spend in these forums worrying about all this spec stuff would be better spent sitting behind an actual eyepiece and learning for themselves how aberrations actually manifest the selves. You learn through hard, dedicated visual observation, not the other way around. Miles Davis didn't become great trumpatere sitting at a computer all day reading about trumpets, he practiced his butt off! Nuff said..",14
Post #910 above by Daniel is worth learning by heart.. But at the very least read the excerpts below:.,1
I bought the Stellarvue soft case. it fits perfectly.. Mike.,0
hummmm... Interesting... Not necessarily a bad thing... Just Kidding! PLEASE don't tell She Who Must Be Obeyed I said that! ;}.,1
"Ginsu knives, I believe. Just rumor of course, which I can neither confirm nor deny at this point.",1
"Fair point Daniel. I do have to say that I have yet to see a scope that is better color corrected than a Takahashi. And that includes the AP 155 I have. Which Daniel can attest to, is very well corrected. Still not at the same level as a Tak in my opinion and in my testing from when I compared the TOA 150 I was replacing with the AP 155. The same applies to the TSA-120 I have. There is just that little extra bit that I can see in terms of what I would call true color.. And my wife and child, who are both Tetrachromat's[1][2] and can see color in DSO's in small telescopes (yes that is actually a thing), see it as well. As an aside this of course sucks royally for me since neither one of them want to have very much to do with visual astronomy and me, the one person who does, can't see color in DSO in small scopes.. [1]https://en.wikipedia...chromacy#Humans. [2]http://discovermagaz...er-human-vision. Oh and the Wiki entry and article is a bit outdated. There are now known to be both male and female Tetrachromat's. I ran into one who is a Optical Engineer who is a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Society. I should also note that there is not 25% of all women having Tetrachromacy. That was a Internet thing that got repeated ad naseum only to be debunked. It is much lower than that. Around, I believe and if I recall correctly, 0.3% or so with some estimates as high as 3%..",1
Oooh! Worth it! Or the nice putter in your image...,0
"I just picked up this scope.  It looks incredible. I can’t wait to give it a try.. Looking down the tube from the front, you absolutely cannot see the lens!.",0
"Why not a TSA 102? It's a beautifully corrected scope.. Edit: I wonder if the ES would be figured as well as the NP or a Tak. OTOH, it's a hobby and your reasons only have to make sense to you!.",0
Or if you don't mind the lovely warm earthly tone of a long FL fluorite doublet - a classic FS-102,1
"Love it! Daniel, thanks for the post.. I have already had a couple of people tell me they are waiting for the fluorite version of the TEC 140 because they ""know"" it will be better than my old ED version.. Oh well.... we live in the Internet Age. Miles Davis didn't have the option of sitting around all day with his nose buried in his ""smart phone"". Thank Goodness for that! Ron.",1
"Oh Daniel, you´re so right!!!!. It just doesn´t matter what kind of glas is inside my scope as long it is fluorit..",0
"Of course ""one” reason that the TOA 150 is “slightly” better color corrected than an AP 155 is because the TOA is “slightly” smaller at 150mm and is slower at F8 and not F7 like the faster AP155. The TSA 120 is of course much smaller but still slower at F7.5.. Bob.",0

,1
"Rob. Now that all this time has rolled by, how about an observing update?. Ever try to see ‘the pup’ - Sirius companion?. Thanks. DD",0
"I actually considered a used TSA-102 first. And it would be my first choice. Unfortunately the tube naked is 5.4 kg or 11.9 lbs. That is over the weight limit of the mount I want to use which is the new Skywatcher AZ-GTi. With rings and everything else it is a fair amount over it. The NP, FC-100, and ES 102 CF with rings etc are just at or only slightly over the max weight for the mount..",0
"That isn't a reason. The TOA is f/7.33 not f/8 and 5 mm will not make that kind of difference. However the TOA does have four elements in it unlike the AP which has only three. However the TOA is air spaced and the AP is oil spaced. If you believe sources here oil spaced is better corrected than air. If that is what blows your hair back fine by me. I am not sure. I can ask a optical engineer I know if someone really really wants to know.. Personally I think it is because the AP is a 2003 model vs. a more recent model TOA I had which is over 12 years newer thus possibly has some advances in manufacturing and polishing and because there are four not three elements including a second ""ED"" element in the TOA. This is also true for the TOA 130. It is what accounts for some of the additional weight in the TOA's above and beyond being built like a tank.. The TSA is only three elements but is smaller and is slightly slower. That might be a push..",1
Could you please add sources to this information? I have never heard of this.,0
Thought it was the FSQ had 4 and TOA had 3 (and Vixen VSD had 5)?.,0
"Well, it (TOA 130)sure feels like four, (attempt at humor). TOA and TSA are both triplet designs. IMO optical masterpieces of the art, not that there aren't others. The FS, I am not sure I can be techno rational, they have held their own against the TOA and TSA - visually to me - IMO, color correction a little different.. Who cares exactly what glass used? when I look through the eyepiece is what matters. These folks have a handle on what they let out the door and that is enough for me. The glass debate is to me second string paper chasing.. I had the 130 's' and it was not that much lighter weight than the TEC apo160ed that I replaced it with.Fortunately I live in a fairly temperate climate. Also took a bit longer to cool if I brought inside -> outside. It and the TSA-120 I have always ran out of seeing before useable magnification?. To me if there is a notable difference it is at the crazy high mag end of the curve, but then I don't have skies to prove that hypothesis.. I do like to recommend to test them or it without a diagonal if possible, that does mean a mount that can get it higher off ground, or using a pier or extension..",0
"The TSA is not that much heavy - here you see it with some slim rings and Vixen style dovtail - maybe the one with sliding dewshield is a bit heavier but I can not imagine that much.. Reg. the TOA-150: it is a triplet design - with three lenses. Reason for the very good correction in all belongings should be the unique design with two ED elements (compared to ""only"" one with most other competitors) and big gaps between the three lenses (compared to much smaller gaps with most other competitors). Enclosed a pic with a green laser showing the big gaps of the TOA.. Next to that the TOA simply is of incredibly high quality in every detail - just watch the complex lens fitting and inner structure. It has the best paint job of all my scopes and a very good individual focuser - of course it gives amazing views of the stars too  As everything is manufactured very, very close to perfection I call this scope a piece of art.. cs. Chris.",8
"oh well - one downside... - weight: in ready to use trim with rings and 3"" dovetail: 18,6kg without the counterweight ring / 23,6 kg with the counterweight ring.. But as I use the 7x50 finder, a 2"" prism/mirror, a ADC and a big eyepiece (e.g. Pentax XW) I don´t need the counterweight ring to bring the scope in perfect balance..",12
I'm not going to get much done today outside sitting here staring at those pictures!.,1
"Sorry, my bad.. However, OPT has the TOA 150B listed as F8. Bob.",0
"The TOA's are triplets featuring WIDE airspace. This allows the lens designer to squeeze out a little more color correction than all the other apos, oil and air-spaced, that have small gaps between the glass.",0
"Those pictures are sooooooooooo nice!. Reminds me of an old advertising slogan, ""The Goodness goes in before the name goes on."" Those pictures show so much goodness! <drool>. Ron.",1
I apologize. You are collectively correct. It is a two ED element design but three lenses. I read it wrong when I first bought it then re-read it wrong when I looked it up yesterday. As an aside I can't stand the new OPT website by the way. Much less informative than the old one. The only Petzval's are the FSQ series..,0
Yeah. Me too. Makes me want the TOA 150 back again... Sigh. Idiot that I am..,0
Chris that is actually great news! Thank you! 4.8 kg with rings is very close to the mount spec. I will email Skywatcher and ask if I am at 5.5 kg/12 lbs (assuming worst) am I still OK? If so I am good and would look at the TSA-102 for sure.,0
"Don't feel bad, Doc. Here I am, strapped into my back brace again and taking more Vicodin --- and I want a TOA 150 so bad I can taste it! What is wrong with us? Takitis is BAD! Ron. PS - The new OPT web site is designed for Millennials with smart phones; they don't use regular computers anymore. I guess we are too old-fashioned..",3
ok you Takheads - two more... profile view: (little fatty )...and business end:.,6
The Stellarvue cases are quite nice. I had one for my TSA-120 a few years back. Highly recommend them. Alan.,0
You're killing us Chris! By the way would you mind weighing the TSA-102 again but this time vertically instead of horizontally? I am curious about something. Thanks in advance!.,0
I tell you Ron I used to say very unkind words when I was mounting and dismounting my TOA 150. But again here I was thinking to cast of the AP 155 which was a good bit lighter and much easier to mount/unmount (and why I sold the TOA in the end) to go after another TOA! You are right! What IS wrong with us?!?.,1
"Carson, I'm curious what your main reason would be for swapping back to the TOA. Would you ever consider a TEC160FL perhaps?.",0
Curious as well. Are the views through the TOA that much better than the AP?.,0
TECs don't come with green focusers.,0
"True, true....",2
"Please excuse my ignorance, but what is an ""ADC""?. Thank you..",0
"Doc,. I have been ""mooning"" over my old TOA-130 while I have a wonderful FS-128 and an even bigger TEC 140 sitting next to me. And as I mentioned, I have been lusting over a TOA-150 since a friend of mine got one six years ago.. My diagnosis: Dual ED Takitis   This appears to be a virulent strain of the disease that attacks the unwary by showing incredible jaw-dropping views. In fact, one of the symptoms is walking around with one's jaw dragging on the floor the next morning - or whenever the subject thinks about what they saw during an earlier session.. The only thing stopping me from getting another TOA is the back brace I am forced to wear and the pain-killers I have to take to lessen the pain in my lower spine. I think that with time, my latest round of DED Takitis will fade and I will still be happy with my beautiful FS-128.. Best of luck in your battle with this disease! Ron.",1
"Allan. At the risk of being burned at the stake as a heretic... There are a few.. The first issue is I saw first hand one of the main issues that can occur with a oil spaced scope. A TEC 140 had been left sitting in a horizontal position for around 5ish years. The oil had settled. I don't know at what point the oil started to settle or why it would do so. I later heard rumors that a seal had blown or some such. TEC resolved the issue immediately upon hearing about it and at no cost other than shipping the scope both ways which speaks highly of Yuri's customer service. However I have a concern that this could end up happening. The other main issue would be the oil becoming somewhat opaque. I have not personally seen this like I did with the oil settling but have heard rumors about it.. The second is the color correction. On my 155 it is fantastic. Daniel Mounsey borrowed it and put it through its paces. His findings were that it was a very very good sample. However I did find the TOA to be better color corrected when I compared the two.. The third is that it is a substantial investment. I can find a very good sample of a TOA 150 for $8,000 used. The delta between the value of the AP and the TOA is enough that I would have funds left over to work with for other things. For example I could be close to being able to afford a used TOA 130 as well.. The only negative to the TOA is its weight. If it were the same weight as the AP it would literally be a no brainer. As it stands it is not the same weight. And that is a significant factor for me.. The same applies to the TEC 140 I have. It is 19 lbs. The TOA 130 is 22 lbs. I would also lose 10mm of aperture. I have found that at about the 8mm mark there is a noticeable difference. That is for me by the way. Others may see a difference at 5mm or only over 12mm.. Lastly... It's a Tak!",1
"Significantly better? No. Better? Yes. Not by much but still better. And that is in my opinion using my eyes, brain, and experience. Others may find otherwise..",0
"Cheers Ron. I think I have it too. As I was typing my reply to Allan I was thinking to myself: Well if I sold the AP, the TEC, and the 12.5"" Teeter Journey Dob with the Zambuto mirror for fair market value I could buy the TOA 150, TOA 130, and a TSA-102 with money left over..",1
@Heywood - ACD means: Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector - this piece corrects color errors caused by atmospheric dispersion - especially planets when standing low shows them at magnifications of about 300x and up. You could see a red glow on one side of the planet and a blue on the other. With the ADC you can completely correct that - image gets visibly better.. @Dr. - can do another weight-shot for the TSA-102 - but not today... (hard day) - but be sure the weight stays the same cs. Chris.,1
"Carson, you might find this air-spaced vs. oil-spaced lens comparison interesting..",0
I'm onboard with your plan right up to selling the Teeter/Zambuto 12.5 unless you are truly a refractor guy and don't set it up regularly.. I think I need to road trip to CA.,0
On a side note - any other threads in the 'Frac forum that garnered 67k views?!?!?!. Maaaaybeeee there'ssomething about Tak?.,0
Cheers Chris. If you still wouldn't mind?,0
Thank you Larry. A interesting read. And good information though I sense that there may be a bit of bias since there were no negatives found.  Besides those images Chris posted are like a Siren Song...,0

"Ed,. Does the 100DF keep up with the M180 on most objects (double stars/planets/brighter globulars), with the exception of fainter galaxies? My 100DC seems to perform as good/sometimes better than a 150 f/12 Synta MCT. Maybe the extra aperture of the M180 would allow it to pull ahead.. Bill.",0
"How do you likeyour TSA-120? When mine was new to me about a year ago, I had a wow moment with the 17Nt4 looking at M42. First of many. This is what I love about the hobby, trying out these amazing Takahashi scopes while I can, having views that are exceptional / memorable. I feel it fits the Tak lineup very well, comparatively small and light compared to the TOA-130, relatively easy on cooldown /acclimation, mounting (my Skyview pro managed fine for visual), crisp and contrasty up until empty magnification..",0
"I also own a TSA 120. I’ve had the scope for 8 years and love it for all the reasons you state. With its exceptionally sharp lens, the scope never seems to disappoint, even in my mediocre seeing.. Bob.",1
I enjoy my TSA as well. It never disappoints. Great for binoviewing too.,0
"I was just browsing through the Kyoei home page today and saw that Takahashi is releasing a flattener for the FSQ85ED :-http://www.kyoei-tok...l/000000007621/I'm a shamed to say I've got my FSQ85ED since Feb or March but not used it. This new product has surprised me as I didn't think the FSQ85ED needed a flattener. It seems due to the popularity of full framed DSLRs being used for astrophotography, Takahashi has brought this out. Focal length increases a little from 450mm to 455mm and focal ratio from F5.3 to F5.4..",0
For full frame DSLR you would need a flattener for the FSQ85 if you want pin point (sharp) stars in the corners..,0
I love the 6x30 finder on that giant refractor! Haha!.,0
is this considered hoarding?.,9
"The TSA120 is very light. I use a TSA120, 7x50 finder, clamshell, finderscope, and a DSLR to image on top of an EM11 with no problems at all..",2
"Maybe I haven't searched hard enough but this was the first I've heard, as such my surprise....unless there are very few FF DSLR users with the FSQ85ED..",0
That isn't hoarding. It's having the right tool for any given job... Anakchan. Most full frame sensor folks go with the FSQ-106 and even then many will use the FF/FR for it.,2
I just verified she works pretty darn well on an M-Zero!,1
"The whole reason why I bought the TSA120 instead of a TOA130 is because I can use the TSA120 on an EM11, even for AP, whereas the TO130 would require at least an EM200/400, at which point I'd just get a TOA150.. The EM11 is the best grab and go GEM out there with go-to and the incredible polar scope allows you to polar align with precision good enough for AP in 30 seconds..",1
"Also, because I have stage 4 takitis, I will not allow any of my Takahashi OTAs to be mounted on anything but a Takahashi mount.. I'm sure you can make the argument that the AP Mach1 is actually the best grab and go go-to mount on the market, and maybe it is, but its just not Takahashi!.",0

"Dave,. Welcome to the TSA 120 club. Of course all that you state dose not surprise any of us TSA 120 owners.. The Mallincam images you get will be near perfect but with video imaging you might want the longer focal length of an SCT (or other long FL scope) for image scale and detail for small objects.. There is one thing that you can be sure of – the more you use the TSA 120 the more you will appreciate its many attributes.. Bob.",0
"Great report!, thank you. (though the quote wrap indicates it is Bob?, I am confused there). I like how you describe the difference between the doublet and triplet in visual terms.It is something I struggle with when both optics are superb. Ihad/have been comparing the -120 to the -100DF (sold a little while ago) and the FS-128 (still here). The 4"" vs. 5"" inch difference at the ep ""me too"", I think it more a 'once you become accustomed to it'thing?, and takes nothing away from the -100DF, a superb optic on it's own merits..",1
"Uh...yeah! But if hoarding Tak equipment is your biggest vice, then that's easily forgiven.",2
"No, hoarding would be to have at least several of each?.",1
Jim is correct. Hoarding would be several of each model. Collecting on the other hand is just one of each model. Or a subset of models. Hoarding is bad. Collecting is good. It keeps one out of the bars.,5
"David,. I would have liked to have seen your new Tak when you came over and seen it in operation with your camera. I look forward to seeing what you accomplish with the pair at DSRSG..",0
"So i'm going back and forth right now on buying a Mewlon 210 vs. Mewlon 250. I've got the cash for a Mewlon 250 and would happily buy one, but the issue is I only have an EM-11 mount with a ~25 pound weight capacity. So if I buy a Mewlon 250, that means I would definitely need to ALSO buy an EM-200 which would just drive the cost through the roof. Trying to maximize my Takahashi obsession while sticking with only the EM-11 mount for now and just buy Takahashi scopes that are within the weight capacity of my EM-11.. Mewlon 210 ($2,100) with EM-11 ($0): $2,100 total. Mewlon 250 ($6,400) with EM-200 ($3,800): $10,200 total. So the Mewlon 250 and EM-200 combo will cost a difference of $8,100 more than just the Mewlon 210. I think i'll just go with the new Mewlon 210, but its fun to think about. Thoughts?.",0
"You could sell the EM-11 to reduce the cost of the EM-200, but your sig shows that it is probably used with the two refractors.....",0
"I use it with both refractors and the EM-11 is nicely packaged in a small pelican case as the ultimate grab and go GEM so definitely keeping it.. I just don't know if I can get by with using a 26.5 pound (probably 30 pounds with eyepiece, diagonal, etc.) Mewlon 250 on a 25 pound capacity EM-11. If its a bit unstable with some shake, etc. that's fine, I just want to make sure I won't burn out the motors or damage the mount if its overloaded by about 5 pounds..",1
Someone will probably chime in soon about this!.,0
"We are mainly dealing with static loads, not dynamic loads, so if you balance the load properly, your gears and motors should be okay.. The major wear (and worry) would be on the axis bearings. The manufacturer sizes the RA and Dec axles and bearings for the design load, plus I'm sure they add a ""fudge"" factor of some sorts. The heavier overall load will be felt more on the RA axis and those are the bearings that will probably wear out first.. Another factor is the tripod. Some manufacturers build mounts that can take a good load, but put them on lighter tripods. This puts an artificial limit on the wear and tear of the mount and helps it last longer.. If you really want a 250 Mewlon, I would suggest you call TNR in Houston and find out just how much load your EM-11 can take and/or if a heavier tripod would help.. Cheers,. Ron.",0
"Buy a mount other than Takahashi and get the Mewlon 250. The 250 will work fine on a a Skywatcher AZ-EQ6, EQ-06-R, CGX, G811G, CEM60, and so on. Or get the 210 and use the EM11 with a decent tripod under it like the one from Takahashi.",4
"Just called TNR, they told me that the EM-11 for visual only can handle the Mewlon 250 and it will not damage the mount whatsoever as long as it's properly balanced. They said it may not track as well, but is fine for visual as long as it's on a good tripod and balanced.....Mewlon 250 here I come!!!",4
Congrats and Enjoy!. Don't forget to share some pictures with the rest of us.. Ron.,2
My Takahashi Mewlon 250 just arrived safely from Greg in New York! Thank you Greg. Taking it out tomorrow for its first spin! WooHoo!!!!!! Here is a pic of my M250 with my FC100DF! My twin Tak Attack!.,21
Careful leaving your Tak FC100DF and Mewlon 250 lying that close together on you bed... you just might come back to find a TSA-120 or Mewlon 180!,4
"nice! I've always wanted to try a Mewlon 250, it seems like the perfect compliment to refractors. It goes on the same EQ mounts and gives you more aperture..",0
The FC100 looks like a 6x50 finderscope next to the Mewlon 250..,0
I was hoping for a TOA150!.,0
You need a Mewlon 300 and TSA-120 for that Mike..,2
,0
"I have a Mewlon 210 coming at the end of the month. I received confirmation from Art at TNR that the Mewlon 250 is in fact too large for the EM-11. So based on this, I just don't want to spend the money on an EM-200 along with a new Mewlon 250, so will be getting the Mewlon 210 to ride on my current EM-11.. When I win the lottery, I will get a TOA-150 and a Mewlon 300 dual mounted side-by-side on an EM-500. Until then, i'll have to just make do with a Mewlon 210 riding on an EM-11!.",3
That's a very practical plan. I have a same one..,2
"How do you like your Mewlon 210? Is it perfect for most DSOs like M13, etc. or do you wish you have more aperture and could go a little bit deeper?.",0
"Most of the time I'm in the city under light polluted sky and my main targets are moon, planets and double stars. I don't think I'll need more aperture for now as I need something portable. But if I win a lottery then it will be different..",1
What mount do you use for your Mewlon 210?.,0
FTX v2 or EM-200. EM-11 is also ok but I need EM-200 for other scopes so sold the EM-11..,0
"Howard, thanks!. Was the Mewlon 210 pretty stable on the EM-11? Were you able to achieve proper balance with only the standard 3.5kg counterweight or did you need to add more weight? Any shakes or unstable experiences with the Mewlon 210 on the EM-11?.",0
Yes it was stable but you need a good tripod. You will also need two 3.5kg counterweight..,0
"The stability of the EM10/EM11 mounts improves significantly when mounted on the EM200 tripod.. For imaging, the EM200 mount with EM200 tripod would be a preferable option, but for visual use, the EM11 on EM200 tripod will do well with instruments at or slightly above the EM11's rated payload..",2
"Agreed 100%. The EM-200 wooden tripod is super sturdy. It uses the same legs as the wooden tripod for the EM-400 mount. I’ve found (as many others have) that a decent or good mount, alt-az or Eq, is only as good as the tripod it’s on.. Cheers,. John.",2
"The Takahashi Luan Wooden Tripods are very sturdy and the surprise for me was how lightweight they are! I thought three 2x4"" legs would weight more.. I'm still enjoying this >1000 post thread and here is my setup from Wednesday. Its good to have more than one Takahashi. Star splitting is pretty easy in the TOA130 but I also like to split Epsilon Lyrae with my FS60 (finder) and 3mm radian just because its fun to do….",7
So do you need to have more then two taks to be considered in the exclusive painful disease called takitis or one can suffice?.,0
"One can qualify especially if you can picture yourself with another one in the not-too-distant future. It’s still early!. Cheers,. John.",2
"I was hoping the two could spend some quality time together and bring me a nice TOA150! So far, nothing has happened!.",0
"Not so much of a new scope, but more a new accessory, the 1.01x flattener for the FSQ-85ED :-.",8
Oh nice you have the GT40 guidescope. How do you like it?  I actually just ordered one last night from Japan for use on my TSA120.,0
I've not tried using the GT40 on my FSQ85ED too but have on my Pentax 125SDP. I found the focus on the GT40 a little fiddly Took me a short while to figure it out..,0
I didn't realize GT40 was that big it's so much smaller in photos.,0
The1.01x flattener for the FSQ-85ED looks very nice. Have you tried it in the field? I might be interested in one as well..,0
I just got it last night and this weekend it's raining. It's actually worse than that. I've had my FSQ85ED since March and I've not taken it out at all..,1
"It took me ages to read the whole thread but it was just as a good thriller : once you've begun you can't stop reading any more ! So many Takahashi fetichists in here, incredible ! Do you think I'm affected as well ?.",16
Congratulations! You definitely made a good start!.,0
This may be of interest: FC-125 and FCT-125.....,19
"A few refractors:. TEC200ED, FS-152 NSV, FC-125, Pentax 105SD, C102F, FC-76, Unitron 60 and an FC-60.",23
I never thought I would see a picture where the FS-152 looks so small! Ron.,3
It looks tiny. Just posted this on a couple of other forums and I've possibly posted this scope here but not in this setup. I've got me a late night outbreak of Takitis and this is the only way to get some relief. Sky 90II on Manfrotto video tripod and DM6..,5
"Ahhh, feels much better. Instant relief. LOL.",0
That video tripod and fluid head looks pretty sweet.  How does it compare to traditional AltAz mounts?.,0
"Just getting back into astronomy after roughly a 9 year break... First add I see is 20% off Takahashi Refractors = instant Takitis!. Ordered a FC100 DF today!. Now I just need a mount, binoviewer, eyepieces, adapters, etc,etc,etc,etc,etc,etc,etc,.... Overwhelmed! Everything thing has changed with different companies, mounts etc.. This is going to hurt the wallet... Bryan V.",3
"It will only hurt until you get your First Light through it.. Just take two Ethos, Naglers, Delos, or DeLites and call us the next morning!. Cheers,. Ron.",1
"It's not a fluid head, it's a Discmounts DM6..",0
Are you sure that mount is strong enough for something as big as the Sky 90?. Ron.,1
"I recommend a Stellarvue M2 mount. I love it because it's smooth, fairly priced and you can add encoders & DSC later. Whole setup can be carried out in one trip..",11
"That is a gorgeous setup, moshen. Does the M2 have a compatible eyepiece holder? I have read good things about it but it seems small, like the FC100DF would be the upper limit of its stable capacity. How stable is that setup for you? I won't be buying a carbon fiber tripod anytime soon but a reference point always helps.. Edit: It seems the new M002C mount from Stellarvue does not support JMI encoders.. Edit 2: BUUUUUT the Astro Devices 311,296 tic encoders for the M2C are available! Holy smokes, what a setup. Maybe I need to get one of these things..",0
"Last night I tried FS-152 on my FTX v2 at home. Charles' mount can handle the 6 inch f8 refractor easily, no sweat. But you do need a heavy and solid tripod. Please ignore the background..",11
I was thinking hard about a FC-100DF but then I just got a line on a matched set of FSQ-106 EDXIV's for sale locally in an estate sale. I could use my FSQ-85 for visual like I planned to use the 100DF and buy one of the 106's. I could sell the 85 and get the two FSQ-106's with a fair bit of added cash I can put together including what I would have spent of the 100DF. I would use one for visual and one for AP. I know about the focuser sag on the EDXIV so I would swap it with a Feathertouch.. Should I just stick with the 85 for AP (it already has a FT focuser) and get the 100DF for visual or go 85/106 or go 106/106? Or do I need to check myself into my local hospital because I have finally lost my mind like my wife has been saying our entire marriage...?.,3
"If you have ever taken a gander through an FC100DF you woukd not be asking that question. Gorgeous, special, exquisite views... on sale to boot.. RUN, don’t walk, to Chris over at Land Sea Sy and ask him to please RUSH you one right now.. Most gorgeous views around!. DD.",1
I was told by the guy in the Tak room at Land Sea Sky that I got the last 100DF... Not sure of future shipments or stock at other vendors.. Bryan V.,0
"That's good news for many, including me, who doesn't want to contract Takitis. Can't want for Nov 22nd, so it will be over. :-).",0
Cheers Dave. Kind of where my head was at. Just had that moment of WOAH! at the idea of a matched set of FSQ's or a small and bigger but not biggest FSQ set. I would want the extender for either for visual if I did it..,0
"Yes, I installed the Astro Devices 311k tic encoders and it's a great setup. I'm not sure about a compatible eyepiece holder - doesn't seem too hard to build or design one to 3D print though.. The mount isn't that small and is a bit weighty at about 7lbs.. The FC100DF is very stable on it - it works fine with my C9.25 too but at about 20lbs loaded that is about the upper limit..",0
"If that’s the tripod for an EM-400, they don’t get much more sturdy than that!. Cheers,. John.",0
That's right. It's heavy (>15kg). Not portable for FTX but really sturdy..,0
"I do believe you may have gotten the last FC100DF in the country. I was told by Astronomics that Takahashi America sold the last one yesterday, and won't have any in from Japan until January. I'll have to console myself with statements like ""my wallet is better off this way""..",1
"Just received notice that an FCT-100 shipped from Japan will arrive tomorrow. Can't wait as I have heard so much about the 4"" FCTs. When it arrives I will add pictures of it, the FCT-125 and an MT-130. They pretty much round out the Tak scopes here at the moment. Fortunately I still have my favorite Tak mount, an NJP Temma, and if the weather holds will be able to get the FCTs out for a little comparison! I have been fortunate over the years to own and use many top flight refractors. Enjoyed them all, but I keep coming back to Taks and own too many at the moment - but have no interest in a ""cure""!.",5
Dang! I suddenly feel like I own a rare telescope! Maybe it's gone up in value already.... Wonder if my wife will buy that story.. I think I already know the answer to that. Better just keep my mouth shut.. Bryan V.,2
"Not something you are likely to see often: an FCT-125 and an FCT-100 together. A friend in Japan found both and I could not pass them up. He said the 100 appeared to be unused and setting it up this afternoon I agree - there isn't a mark on it. The FCT-100 is hard enough to find but the FCT-125 is far more rare. I spoke to Art at TNR prior to buying it and he said as few as 10 may have been made. I am sending this one to TNR to clean and collimate though I collimated it when it arrived and when I took it out the images were stunning! Storms are predicted here for the next several days so ""first light"" with the 100 will not happen soon. Two beautiful scopes!.",22
"Wow, very nice pair of fine, rare scopes!",0
I have a Mewlon 210 coming to me directly from my favorite Japanese dealer and there is a 50% chance it will be here on Saturday and a 50% chance it will be delivered on Monday. You guys know how I feel right now..,3
"Very nice! I had one for a while a couple of years ago, and also bought mine directly from Japan..",0
How was your Mewlon 210 and why did you decide to sell it?.,1
"I know you exactly how you feel waiting for things shipped from Japan. It is SO exciting to know the scope is coming, yet agonizing until it arrives safely. Over the years I have shipped scopes to Australia, Germany, Slovenia, Canada and about every state in the US. I always sweat them getting here safely, or""there"" safely when I am the seller/shipper. Best wishes to you with your new scope - the Mewlon 210 is such a marvelous instrument. Enjoy it!.",1
"All of our Takahashi's at one time or another were shipped to us from Japan.... I figure its safer by cutting out the middle man and just having it come directly to my doorstep! Buying used from overseas, I would definitely worry, but the dealer I always buy from is pretty robust and always ships EMS and I usually have things within 2-3 days. Quicker than ground shipping from the West coast!.",1
"It was a nice scope, and one that I had wanted to try out for a long time before I bought it. But in all honesty, I realized after a few months that it didn't really give me anything that I didn't already have in a scope lineup that already consisted of 4"" and 5"" Tak apo doublets and a 8"" Meade SCT. It had good optics, about the same level of image shift as my Meade SCT, somewhat finicky collimation (inherent in the Dall-Kirkham design), and diffraction spikes that the SCT didn't have. Plus it was way more expensive than the SCT. I was hoping that the open tube design of the Mewlon would lead to more rapid thermal equilibrium than the SCT, but that didn't turn out to be the case, especially in the winter.. But please don't misunderstand me. The Mewlon 210 was still one of the nicest scopes I've ever owned. It's just that I felt that my SCT was a better value. Now I know that SCTs can be hit or miss, and there are plenty of dogs out there, but my SCT happens to have quite good optics. IMO the Mewlon had all the disadvantages of the SCT design, plus a major disadvantage of the D-K design, plus was much more expensive than an SCT. It did have a nice mirror with very good optics though. But that led to another problem. After buying the Mewlon I found that I was observing through that scope exclusively and ignoring my FS-128. And I really didn't want to sell the FS-128, as that was really my favorite scope. In the end I decided I couldn't keep two scopes as expensive as the FS-128 and the Mewlon simultaneously. So the FS-128 and Meade SCT ended up staying and the Mewlon 210 got sold..",2
"I must say, my ""Takitis"" had me feeling a little queasy today when my FC100DF DF surprisingly. showed up early... I wasn't expecting it until Monday so that was good news... What I wasn't real happy about was when I finally got down to the 3rd box and saw a baby blue focuser!??. NOT a fan!. Is this a recent change or am I the last person to know about it? Thankfully I didnt order the Tak finder scope bracket and tube ring yet. They are going to clash with this focuser... The rest of the scope is stunning. The tube paint is deeeeep and beautiful.... Lens coatings are the best I can remember seeing, although I have been out of the hobby for 9 years. Wont be able to test this little beast until I can find a mount, and rings for it... Bryan V. Edit: After a quick internet search I found this photo which verifies my clash suspicion... Yuck!.",2
https://www.cloudyni...e/?hl=tak green. careful mixing ole gray/ ole green with new mint blue and blue/black parts.,1
"I really don't understand why Tak went to the new blue style colouring. When people say Takahashi green, everyone knows what they are talking about. It's a classic..",0
I totally agree Bryan and Allan. I'm not a fan either. My former TSA-120 was Tak green. It was indeed distinctive and complemented the creamy white tube color quite nicely. The change also makes mixing and matching accessories less palatable unless you happen to be a color blind astronomer..,0
"guys, keep cool and be thankfull - Takahashi colors up your live!. Its´a meeee - Mario.",0
"There is no colour diference in a dark place...city location can be a problem, for shure... ..and solar obs.",0
"Agreed. Sea foam green is a classic, easily recognizable color, that to me just says ""Takashashi."".",0
"Tak also went to the blue color for the clamshells and finder brackets, etc. Their colors match the focuser color..",1
"My FC76 and Mewlon 210 are both the new blue color. In person, the blue is a lot more deep in color than any of the photos I've seen posted online where it looks more ""sky blue"" when in fact it's not.. I am a big fan of the blue color. Just like everything Takahashi does, there is elegance, and the depth of color, the matteness, and the finish is superb and very visually appealing. It is a change though and many Tak owners who have all green probably won't want the odd ball out. But at the same time, Takahashi was originally a deep gun metal gray before switching to green and the moaning and groaning was unbelievable at the time, I mean, how could you go from a nice neutral good looking deep gray color scheme to of all things an UGLY SEAFOAM GREEN? Everyone, and I mean everyone hated the seafoam green because it was a far bigger change to go from gray to green than it was to go from green to a blue with only a slight difference. Tak fanatics were saying at the time that Takahashi would go bankrupt because no one would buy the new ugly seafoam green color, and I think we all know how true that turned out to be.. The iconic attributes of Takahashi is the pearl white tube with incredible fit and finish, not seafoam green. Seafoam green is just what people have been used to seeing for the last 20 years.. All this hanger means is that Whenever you buy Tak accessories now, you MUST tell the store you're buying from If you want the blue or green. Green isn't being manufactured anymore and all new stock of all Tak accessories are blue, but many stores still have green accessories they're still selling till current stock runs out..",5
Your right about the photos on line. The new blue isn't very photogenic... It does look better in person and goes well with the silver tube rings on my FC100DF... I'm still not a fan though.. Maybe Ill put a Feathertouch on mine. We'll see.. Bryan.,0
Here is my new FC100DF.. It took a few shots but I think this photo is pretty close to what I see in person as far. as the new color.,13
"Tak went from gray to sea foam green to this new blue color on their focusers and trim accessories. I also remember that my old TOA-130 had red trim around the dew shield.. Maybe I'm being contrarian, but my FS-128 has a blue band at the dew shield, blue lettering, and it also has the blue serial number plate. I like blue! I wish it had the blue focuser and a blue CAA, too.  Maybe Tak will make a special run of the old FS series with blue focusers for those of us who really want our accessories to match. YMMV regarding the colors, but all of us love the views through these scopes.. Cheers,. Ron.",10
"Ooops! Lest I forget. I also replaced the green manhole cover with a lighter weight blue Lens Hoodie (dust cap). If I drop this one, I won't break any toes.. Ron.",9
"Ron,. Where did you get that blue lens hoodie from???",0
Ron got it from a company called LensCoat. I just happened to know the answer since I asked him the same question a few months ago..,1
"Ron: The FS-128 telescope has such a beautiful form. They are the embodiment of what a handcrafted instrument of high quality should look like. All in my opinion, of course. In full disclosure, I (bias) am the happy owner of one, too.. Regards,Randy.",3
Thanks Scott - one more thing to buy... does it ever end?.,2
I agree. But then I'm biased just like you are.,2
"Of course not. But as cool as I think the hoodie cover looks, I won't be buying one anytime soon. I like the heavy Tak green ""manhole"" cover..",2
"Scott,. You made the right call based on your circumstances. Now you know what I meant about the radical behavior of an open tube. Far from a picnic walk. At Oak Park where I conduct my star parties, my M250 usually looks no different than an ordinary 10"" or 11"" SCT because of the unpredictable and horrible temperature drops in the valley and the optics go into thermal shock. This is what happens when substrate is exposed to the immediate cold, falling air. People often buy a Mewlon thinking something's going to look better and it doesn't work that way. It's like a Bugatti. It drives normal like most cars around town, but unless you have a proper long stretch of road to open it up, it drives at the same speed like other cars on the road. I don't even bother setting my Mewlon up at oak park unless I'm looking at fainter star clusters that are too faint to resolve in the smaller fracs. I mainly use it at home near sea level where the deltas are very minimal. Because I have on-shore air, it never gets cold all the sudden like oak park. Once I settle the optics down by about 10 or 11pm I can rely on passive cooling and it's all smooth sailing from there. No SCT I've ever compared from this location can resolve such detail and contrast..",5
"Thanks for the reply, Daniel. Despite everything I said above, I'm really glad that I got the opportunity to try a Mewlon out for a while. It really was quite a nice scope, just not the one for me. But as I've said over and over again, I'm more of a refractor guy anyway.",0
"Agreed!!! The FS-128 is a classic long-ish focal length refractor. Couple that with the great fluorite crown lens and it works as good as it looks.. LensCoat ships fast and their Hoodies protect your objective very well. I have used their stuff for a few years now. For the FS-128, you will need the largest size they make: XXXXL.. BTW - You can also buy camouflage colors, in case you want to hide your scope from the neighbors.. Cheers,. Ron.",3

"So fellas, to be honest, as soon as the Mewlon 210 showed up yesterday I had an epiphany and thought to myself... why don't I just sell my TSA-120 and Mewlon 210, both in mint and brand new condition respectively, and then buy a TOA-150?. A TOA-150 is my dream Takahashi, and right now I have almost the monetary equivalent sitting in my living room in the form of a TSA-120 and Mewlon 210.. What do you guys think.... sell the TSA-120 and Mewlon 210 and then buy a TOA-150? I'm not concerned about grab and go... thats what the FC-76 is for!.",1
There's a lot to be said for following your dream. Life is short and uncertain. Do it!.,5
Go for it!!. You only live once!.,1
"Do you have a mount that can handle a TOA-150? The 150 is a pretty large, heavy scope. If you'll need to buy a beefier mount, don't forget to factor that cost into your decision..",0
Hear hear...life is indeed too short...make your dream reality!.,0
I haven't bought a TOA-150 due to its weight and cool down time. If these are not your concerns then you should definitely go for it..,2
"As one of the legends here on CN's says, chase your dreams because no one else is going to.. The optics in my TOA130 are essentially perfect, and it's hard to believe sometimes that it is only a 5"" telescope. The TOA150 is just more of that goodness..",4
From experience (I owned a TOA-150 and presently own a TSA-120 and Mewlon 210) the combination of the TSA and Mewlon is much more enjoyable than the TOA. Get an AZ-EQ6 and mount them side by side. Heck you could put the 76 on the TSA as a super finder. It is a really really great combination.. I enjoyed the views in the TOA but always found myself making rude hand gestures and saying very bad words at it each time I put it on or took it off the mount. It also got to the point where I looked for reasons not to use it. And I am no wall flower. It is a very heavy unwieldy scope.,2
"As nice as the TOA150 is, it is something I can't see myself buying..... 24Kg minimum by the time you get a finder, tube rings, diagonal and an eyepiece...... Then again if you have an EM400, a decent pier and a sliding roof to cover it......... The views certainly are superb... You only live once and you don't get to take them with you....",1
"Do you guys think an AZEQ5 instead of an AZEQ6 would be able to handle a TSA-120 and Mewlon 210? I would never use it for imaging, just goto dual OTA in altaz mode.. Mewlon 210 and TSA-120, both outfitted with diagonols, eyepieces, rings, etc. weighs 34.1 total combined pounds. Payload capacity of the AZEQ5 is 15kg (33 pounds!)..",0
Properly balanced the mount should be ok but the tripods are made of half-cooked pasta and would become immensely annoying in no time......,3
I agree with Matt. Don't skimp on the mount and overload it..,1
"Actually Matt is referring to the tripod legs - this is my experience as well regarding tripod Vs mount. A decent set of legs will reduce jitters a lot and thus ""increase"" the effective mount payload, whereas a heavy duty mount on bird like tripod legs is a recipe for failure!.",3
"A user here (twkelley) is currently having massive wobbling problems with his AZ-EQ5 and SV125-Access, which is probably around 20-22lbs loaded up. I would not have expected this but having read about it (and will see it myself this weekend), I would not even dare putting a TSA120anda Mewlon 210 on it. At least not without a much better tripod..",1
"OK, this is a long shot but I'll ask. Anyone owned both a C102F f/9 and a new version Tak FC100 DL f/9?... not necessarily at the same time. I owned a C102F many years ago and it was one of the most outstanding 4"" Refractors I've ever had the pleasure to use! Since then I've been spoiled by many Tak Refractors. I'm considering a new FC100 DL, wondering how the two 900mm f/l scopes compare?.",0
"Hear! Hear!. When I had my old EQ-6, I had an adapter made so I could place the mount on an Astro-Physics Portable Pier. The -6 was also limited by the tripod more than by the mount's axles and bearings. With the proper legs underneath, it could easily handle loads a bit higher than its rated capacity.. The TOA-150 is also on my ""Dream List"" and I will probably buy one as soon as I win the Lottery and can build a nice observatory around it.. Cheers,. Ron.",1
"Matt - don´t make that little fatty heavier then it is So the scope including, rings, 3"" rail, connection plate between rings and dustcap is point 18,6 kg.. The counterweight is separat 4,7kg but not needed to come in balance when I use the 8x50 finder, 2"" diagonal, dispersion corrector as shown here:. I first fix the rings with rail and connection plate on the mount and then set in the scope itself - I´m not sure how much the ring-rail-combo is but I guess 3-4kg for sure - so the scope as heaviest single part is ""only"" about 14 to 15kg but in a compact, well to manage package.. While the 24kg are correct if you add everything up - I never carry these around in one piece - so no problem.. I use a AP600 / Parmont 2 mount on the old Losmandy tripod - the combo is rock solid (it can manage my 185 apo for visual without problems!). EQ-5 will be on it´s limit depending the tripod - but maybe it works - just to be proofed. The TOA 150 was my dreamscope too - and as mentioned before - it just is! No other scope I had or have has this kind of ""perfection grade"" - just setting it up is pure fun (for me, as it is alway a little bit special) and when you look through - your socks gets blown off and you know why this scope is known to be one of the best.. So asking me if you should go for it instead of a ""spiked"" Cas or smaller Apo - YES! definitely!. csChris.",3
"Chris:. Don't you, or didn't you, have a CFF 160, too? If so, how does it compare to the TOA-150 for visual use?. Thank you!. Heywood.",0
"Hi Heywood,. the CFF160 is sold but it was ideed a great scope!. As a oil spaced triplet its color correction was not at the same level as the Tak but therefore faster at cooldown. When I sold it in winter we waited about 2h until it was cooled downed to a grade the buyer said - woww, yes! I wanna have it!  The Tak will need at least 1h longer with its wide spaced lenses... (not tested it yet) there always are pros as well as cons.... Spherical correction was nearly on the same level as the Tak.. So I would recomend this socpe - no question.. cs. Chris.",0
"I know a guy that runs a fully loaded TOA-150 on his AP Mach One... I think hes around 25-28lbs over the max-rated load and it actually images fine. He balances very carefully, and just slews really slowly. I cringe to think what the strain on the bearings and RA pivot bolts must be though... but its a great little mount. Looks hilarious though, the Mach One looks pretty spindly underneath that thing.. He's close to my age (50+ something) and is relatively fit from what I can tell. He says its no problem transporting that rig around for imaging. If you're fit enough, its a heck of a setup... but you do need a strong rigid mount to run it, even for visual.. EM200, Mach One, AP900, MyT or MX, Titan, EQ8, CGXL (maaaybe). I know I'd love to have one.",0
EM200 for a TOA150?  Will that work for imaging as well or just visual?.,0
I use the Zeiss Parmont2 (what is 1:1 identical to the AP600) and nearly identical to the EM200 - the TOA works great on that mount. I´m just visual but I´m sure it would work for AP too.. My dreammount would be the EM-400 - but it´s too expensive and I didn´t saw one used yet.... The Mach1 was to wobbly for my taste - compared it (on Eagle tripod) directly to the AP600 (on Losmandy tripod) - the AP600 was more stable - swingout times clearly shorter..,0
"Considering that Roland rates the Mach 1 at 45 pounds for IMAGING and says it will carry at least 60-70 pounds for a visual load, I hate to think what your friend has attached to his TOA-150.. I am also surprised to read that the A-P 600 carries a TOA-150 better than the Mach 1 - since the 600 is only rated at 25 pounds for imaging. Anyway, a friend of mine has a beautiful TOA-150 and it only weighs about 45 pounds with rings, dovetail, and the accessory ring. My Mach 1 can easily carry it - but I cannot.. Cheers,. Ron.",0
"Hi Ron, I was surprised too - bought the Mach1 as upgrade from the AP600 but it was not - unfortunately... It was a downgrade. Maybe because of the Eagle tripod I don´t know - swingout times with the saddled CFF185 was about double the time vs. the AP600 on the Losmandy tripod.. I was surprised too when I put both mounts next to each other - the AP600 looks and feels much more massive then the Mach1 just compare the bases of the mounts.... Full CNC or not I found the AP600/Losmandy the more stable solution and sold the Mach1..",1
EM-200 won't be good enough for TOA-150. I have a EM-400 with the thinking of getting a TOA-150 but then just settled with my FS-152. I can sell the EM-400 but shipping it will be too difficult..,1
"Thanks for the picture. I have never seen a 600 at our star parties to compare. I knew it was sand-cast aluminum and maybe that is why Roland stated a lower capacity. I have set my Mach 1 next to a Losmandy G-11 and the G-11 is much smaller, which surprised a few people.. I don't think either one (Mach 1 or the 600) would be my choice for a 185mm refractor. I would go for a 900-1100, but that will never happen because I decided over ten years ago that the Mach 1 would be it for me. If I cannot carry the scope on this mount, I will not be buying it. Cheers,. Ron.",0
"The CFF is only a little bit longer then the TOA-150 but has about the same diameter - so not a big difference to saddle the one or the other... that is another BIG pro for CFF apos - their ""lens diameter/ tube size"" ratio is unbeatable.... But just if the 185 gives the more spectacular views - no question... I love the TOA for what it is - the queen of 6"" apos and woww - a hot one!.",2
Perhaps an EM400 setup like this.......,11
"It would be interesting to see how they both would do on the Losmandy tripod. Looks can be deceiving, the Mach1’s worm wheel is nearly 50% larger.. A used 900GTO is about the same price and is a better choice all around for a scope that size..",0
yepp!!!.,0
"Would have been interesting, but I had no matching adapter and it would have cost me another 100+ EUR to get one. I bought both mounts used but for the Mach1 setup I payed many times the price of the AP600 setup and as it was clear that the Mach1 will in best case come to par (but not much better) I decided to let it go.. I´m sure if someone uses it for AP with a 5"" scope the Mach1 is one of the absolute best - because most precise mounts around - but for my needs (only visual with 6"" and 7"") it was the wrong match.. One can ask if a AP600 now is the right match for an 7"" apo? Of course - a more heavier mount would be better - but as as the setup is very solid and allows maximum magnifications (400-500x) without any wish to have it more stable - why I should carry more? This setup is very convenient to setup: one walk for the tripod, one walk for the mounthead - it just works..",0
"I have both a Losmandy tripod and the A-P Eagle pier. The Eagle is a heck of a lot more portable and maneuverable around the house, but both work fine. Of course, I never ran anything bigger than my TEC 140 on them, either.. Cheers,. Ron.",0
"Not sure how anyone could find the AP600 better than the Mach1 in any way other than simplicity with the single clutch knobs.  I made the move and the Mach1 was significantly more stable with my 160mm refractor, which corresponds to the manufacturer's load ratings. FWIW..",2
"for my use (just visual) and as mentioned in combination with the Losmandy tripod (AP600) vs. Eagle tripod (Mach1) and CFF185 on top:. let me see.... - about half the swingout time >> 2s vs. 4s. - two clutch levers vs. six little clutch knobs. - in slewing much more silent. - easier to get the tripod out of the balkony door.  (simply take one leg of and on while complete standing vs. folding three legs up and down while kneeing). all that for about 1/5 the price and nearly the same weight... there was ZERO reason to stay with the Mach1 for me.. CFF185 on AP600 aka Zeiss Parmont2 with Losmandy tripod (old version). CFF185 on Mach1 with Eagle tripod. Btw. I doubt not one second that the Mach1 is the much more precise and more ""sweeter looking"" and to higher standard manufacured mount and would be my Nr2 for any AP ambitions with 5"" or 6"" apos (Nr1 would be 10micron 1000hps).. I bought the Mach1 because I read here at CN, that it is the (significantly) more stable mount over the AP600 and then was very suprised to find the opposite in reality... especially after paying A LOT of bucks just for the used one. At this point I just had a buyer for the AP600 but after some testing I had to cancel the deal (what left over a very disappointed guy).. So as you can see by above reasons - ""someone"" can find a AP600 better.. wait... one thing I really miss: these metal plates to lay down some equipment or eyepieces were great!. csChris. P.S.: seems to be a bit off topic here so better come back to Tak things",1
"Folks. The Mach1 is rated for 65 lbs. for imaging with a reasonable moment arm. Not 45. So a TOA 150 with all the trimmings or a EdgeHD 14"" are possible.",1
"and the AP600 for 25lbs. sorry - but from my experience both values are rubbish - what the AP600 is underrated the Mach1 is over.. The CFF185 as shown in above config is point 19,7kg what is about 43lbs (without finder and diagonal) - for my taste it was to much for the Mach1 but rides well on the AP600 (but please keep the tripods in mind! I don´t know their influence here!). The TOA-150 with rings and plate is 1kg lighter and a bit shorter then the CFF - it maybe will work better (I didn´t tested it with the Mach1) but I don´t think if a camera is added it will be a stable combo.. cs. Chris.",0
"Chris. I confirmed it with a AP. And the AP 155 Mach1 combination is confirmed for AP as well. AP for whatever reason substantially under rated their mount capacity until very recently.. Perhaps you had a bad sample, had an error somewhere like trying to use it on a patio of a flat, or weak tripod, or something else. The issue isn't the weight of the TOA or the CFF or for that matter a TEC 180. It's the moment arm.. EDIT: I saw you mentioned tripod. Yes the tripod makes a difference.",1
"Chris,. To me it looks like your Eagle pier was set very high and I am afraid that height along with the narrower spread of the tripod legs had a negative effect on your Mach 1's stability. I also wondered if maybe your clutches weren't tight enough.... But that is all water under the bridge. You ran your own test and made the proper decision for yourself.. BUT - I can help you with one thing: I also like the trays that A-P makes and I adapted my Losmandy tripod so I could use a couple of them. You have to drill and tap the mounting holes just right so the trays sit just above the legs. But they work great and I got a lot of comments about them at our club's big star party a few years ago.. Here are a couple of pictures to show you how I did it.. Cheers,. Ron. Back to Takahashi! I can tell you that my FS-128 is steady as a Rock with my Mach 1..",4
"Ron, that's NICE! I need to do that! And as you say back to Tak... My Mewlon 250, my old TOA 150 (that I replaced because it was too heavy) with counterweight, and all my smaller Tak's ride like they aren't even there on my Mach1.. Speaking of which EVERY darn time I see that TOA 150 and TOA 130 I want to sell my TEC 140 and AP 155 and replace them with the TOA 130 and 150. Completely irrational and stupid I know but those two are quite the beauties! Plus the color correction in the TOA I had was unrivaled. Beats the AP and TEC hands down. Not by much but enough to be noticeable...",4
"Nice, Ron! I really need a stable tracking mount for my FS-128, but a Mach 1 would break the bank. I've mounted the FS-128 on my CG5-ASGT before, but that mount is really too lightweight for my liking with that scope. So right now my DM6 is the only suitable mount I've got for the FS-128..",0
Scott - A AZ-EQ6 would fit the bill. One scope on each side... Or a Losmandy GM811G. Though the Losmandy is a bit of overkill unless you plan to do serious AP...,1
"Hi Ron,. great idea! unfortunately my plates went together with the mount - hell! one of them was a birthday present from my girlfriend - she was very upset about selling ""her present""... hui ui ui ui ui. Had to compensate that...wish I had seen your fix before the sale!.",1
Yes...someday.,0
"Am flying my 128 on a CGX, works very nicely and it's a very quiet mount, at least by my ear.(I know there were unfortunate teething issues with the mount manufacture but mine only had issues with the HC firmware, taken care of easily)Holds the scope like a rock, I dislike any vibration when I'm fine focusing at any mag but double at the higher end. Regarding the Mach1, I used one imaging with a TECapo160ed and it was fine doing long exposure narrowband, but that was a relatively light scope for the aperture, but it was physicallyl o n g at f/8.I should addthe Mach1was on a permanent concrete reinforced pier. Back to present day, the FS-128 at f/8.125 is also l o n g but the weight distribution more even front to back, or it's less nose heavy than triplet designs..",1
"My FS-128 is carried on a iOptron iEQ 45Pro with the 2-in tripod. I bought the mini-pier so I could shorten the tripod leg length and have great results in a mount that I can carry out with CW, easily. I still have the original Tak single speed focuser, and vibration from making focus adjustments lasts about 2 seconds, I can live with that, no problem. I also have the iOptron CEM60 with the mini-pier. It carries the FS-152 with ease and, having a FT focuser, there is no vibration to speak of. That mount really impresses me because of the relatively robust payload capacity in a package that I can carry it out with the CW on, if desired. I know iOptron may have had some hiccups with the early introduction of their mounts, but I purchased recently and those have been worked out. And, if one has a question about one of their products, an email gets a prompt, well instructed, response. Just another option to consider.. Randy. PS: I operate these in Eq mode, but the iEQ 45Pro can be configured for alt-az..",1
I tried to be as polite and succinct as possible but you're just trolling. Trolling tends to take things off topic. Overloading your mount and then calling it more stable than mounts with bigger bearings and capacity is just silly stuff.  You're welcome to be a silly and nonsensical as you want but I will post a correction in case someone else is reading this and trying to evaluate these mounts.. Just for the record an AP600 is way undersized for a 185mm refractor..,0
we could go on discussing that here:https://www.cloudyni...h-for-a-7“-apo/. cs. Chris.,0
"Yes, you sound totally irrational and you might also be a bit ""touched"". But guess what? So am I. Here I own a beautiful mint condition FS-128 and a wonderful TEC 140, yet I still have vivid memories of my old TOA-130. I know I shouldn't do this - heck, I can't even lift the darn thing anymore! But I cannot get those beautiful views from the TOA out of my mind. Plus, my old TOA was one of the early ones (52/53) -- and that is still the one I want.. Totally irrational........... That doggone Takitis......... It is a very strange disease.............. Ron.",3
"Having looked through my TOA130S and TOA130NFB on many many nights, I think it is perfectly rational to want one that badly....... The TOA130 is optical perfection.... Since selling mine I have tried to take refuge in the big aperture of my 18"" as well as the immaculate contraption that is the TEC MakCass.... to no avail.... I am now seeking solace in my somewhat customised TSA120 refractor and the itty-bitty FOA60.... I hope I can finally come to terms with my Takitis.......",2
buh !. I don´t understand you guys - Takitis is the only of the big plagues that can easily be healed with one big TOA. Imagine you suffer on TECitis or TMBiritis or something else... - the push for more would beexcruciating.,6
Looks like I am doomed to buy a TOA 130 and 150 and go back to making rude hand gestures as well as saying very bad words as I mount and dismount them...,3
"All is not lost, Doc! I might have discovered a temporary inoculation for Takitis. It is called ""A Good Night's Sleep"".  And coupled with that other malady, ""Funds are low"" it might save us some serious angst.. Fortunately, I didn't pull out the credit card and buy a TOA-130 last night. And after a good night's sleep, I woke up and realized that I still have two of the world's best visual five-inch refractors sitting in my house already. The FS-128 and TEC 140 also offer stunning views and both come with the added benefit of not messing up my back when I carry them. Phew! Dodged another bullet!. Cheers,. Ron.",6
But - hey I know that feeling very well - works at least until next evening...just wait until the next episode - Takitis is malicious and to put lipstick on a pig is no solution.... cs. Chris.,0
I know there is no cure... I am simply trying to cope.. Ron.,0
"It’s refreshing to hear that there are some of us that freely admit that we have this disease. And I’m happy for those that don’t have to deal with such a powerful force that seems to take control when we least expect it.. One message I’m receiving here is that selling off a Tak will likely cause angst in the future. I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks!. Cheers,. John.",0
"What is this strange thing you call... ""Sleep"", Ron?",2
One day at a time Ron. One day at a time.... What makes it worse is there is interest by some folks in both the AP155 and the TEC 140. Still waiting to hear what they would offer. If it's close to the cost of the two TOA's... I am DOOMED!.,1
"The results are now in...... Takitis in its severest form can cause double vision and to that end there is only one treatment for the affliction which can also empty one's wallet rather quickly.... https://www.cloudyni...f75-binoculars/. Help me, I am a TakaHolic......",6
"I just recently got infected by the Tak virus, worse I’ve been spending time working with Daniel Mounsey so I’m terrified of the extent of the Tak infection.. My first Tak..",2
Matt. That is possibly the most wonderful yet frightening thing I have seen! How much did the doohickeys to make them binoscopes cost and where did you get them?,0
@ Matt - simply awesome and can't wait to see finished binoscope @ Doc - AOKSwiss has a ready made platform if you are interested. And sells complete TSA120 Binoscopes to boot!. Check out the BB-160 underBinokulareon the menu at the left side of the landing page(his website is a bit weird)..,0
Nick. Two TSA's is a scary thought...  And the AYO series mounts and I didn't get along too well so I am a bit leery of their products. Beat was great to work with and did everything he could to address things but the cascade of issues was a bridge too far for me in the end. The cost of shipping back and forth alone was a big hurdle. A me problem not a AYO problem.,1
What's could be so scary about a couple of little 'fracs...... I'll just have to live on air and water for a few months.... need to lose a little weight anyway... Always look on the bright side of life.... P.S. There really is glass in those tubes though it don't look it.....,6
So it's time to post this again....,9
I don't know if I should offer my congratulations or my condolences!. You are treading on a very slippery slope! Welcome to the insanity. Ron.,0
Hoarders! No wonder these scopes getting so rare today!.,1
"Good point Matt. I can always trap rats, feral cats, and dig through the bins behind restaurants for food...! Are those AYOSwiss doohickies to make them a binoscope?.",0
I thought about the AOK Swiss ones but liked this DooHickey better. I first saw the on Range's beautiful APM-LZOS binoscope. PM Sent..,0
"My Takitis is bad... Went out last night to a dark site with my FC100DF and Mewlon 250. Spent 90 minutes viewing with FC while the Mewlon cooled. It was AMAZING! Then mounted the Mewlon and AHHHHH!!! Then, out of nowhere, I started thinking about a TOA130, what I could sell to fund it, and how to approach the wife! These symptoms are identical to what happened prior to the FC100DF and Mewlon purchase. UGHHHH!.",2
"Thanks Matt!. Mike, tell her you can't put a price on happiness and if she loves you she will help you.",1
That wouldn't work in my household. My wife would then turn my words around and use them to apply to new furniture. And I'm afraid that that would be even more expensive than the nicest scope that I'd want to buy!,2
"Ask your wife if she has a good use for $2,000 because that’s the money you just saved by ordering a Tak TSA 120 instead of a TOA 130.. Bob.",0
"I think the TOA-150 would fill the gap between the 100DF and 250 Mewlon a little better than either the TSA-120 or the TOA-130.. IMHO, The main problem managing Takitis is there are simply too many great options to choose. If Takahashi only made two or three great telescopes, it would be so much easier. Buy a couple and you feel fine! But NO! We have to decide between a dozen or more options. Arrgh!. Ron.",0
My problem right now is that I really enjoy displaying my Takahashis mounted on tripods in my living room. Issue is I only have one EM11.  I need to buy more Tak mounts not scopes.,1
"Or, you can tell her that you’ve saved over $3,000 by buying a used TOA-130F (or s) instead of a new one. And that you can sell it someday down the road for about the same price in case you’d need to. Never mind saying that you’d need to so that you can get a TOA-150 Cheers,. John.",1
You'd still likely prefer the TEC140. The only Tak in the same league as the TEC is the TOA-130.,0
"Takitis is not a bad thing, except for the wallet. I love all my Taks from my lowly FC-50 to the mighty FS-152. It's a toss up between the FS-152 and the FCT-100 as to which is actually my favorite.",0

"It is front heavy yes - but I think it´s not too bad. As shown in the picture with retracted dew cap and 8x50 finder it is nearly in balance (not complete) - if you then extend the dew cap you need some more weight at the end too. (would not have been nessesarry for the photo as it rides on the top of the mount... - but looks a bit more like ""Bertha"" this way  ).. With 2"" diagonal, and a bigger eye-piece like Pentax XW or some other pounds for a dispersion corrector it´s all fine... I never had any problems with that matter and nor I ever needed the separate counter weight.. cs. Chris. Btw. @Ron - thanks for the hint with the AP plates on the Losmandy tripod - faster then I thought - I was lucky to find a complete solution with two of them and the newer (adjustable) tripod... great!.",1

I chose fluorite for my finderscope too, but mine is in the form of a Borg 55FL, a Baader amici prism (astronomical quality 90°) and the Explore Scientific 24mm 68° (yes, yes, my Pan 24 looks better but the ES is all black like the Borg - plus I don't feel right using the Pan on a finderscope!) for a TFOV of 6.5°. Of course, I can go 2"" on the Borg for 10°+ but it would look ridiculous!. I am waiting for Mark of Moonraker to finish a custom made ring which I will use to fit the Borg on the side of my FS-128. The Tak plaque from my focuser is coming off and will go on that ring (I am replacing the focuser with a 3"" FTF). Meanwhile.... That's with the Pan. The ES adds a bit more bulk and a bit more weight to it, but you can see where this is going....",3
"The FOA is actually going onto a little SW AZ-GTi mount atop my Manfrotto MT055CXPro3 tripod for lightweight travels and quick looks..... That Borg looks the goods Nick. Very Nice. I used the Baader SkySurferV on my TOA and TEC Mak and love it, I use Telrads on my Dobs.. I know I promised no more pics but I just tried the binos on the AZ-EQ6 and I think they will be fine for up to about 180x..",13
"More photos are always welcome (and expected) I do manual star-hopping and while I use a Telrad or RDF, I just use it to more or less point the scope. The finderscope is far more important to me as I enjoy huge star-hops (the challenge, the finding stuff on the way to an object, the wide field vistas), hence the upgrade.. Is that counter-weight enough???.",0
"For field use I will use the extension on the counterweight bar to move the c/w out another 150mm. This counterweight is 10.6Kg, the Bi-Tak weighs in at 15.5Kg and the tripod is super stable.....",0

"Matt, that's a beautiful setup. Which Tak tripod are you using? Can't wait for your first light..",0
"Thanks, the tripod is the TMT70300 for the EM400 courtesy of ""TheFacelessMen"", though I did have to twist his arm and throw $$$ at him to get it from him.",0
Nice choice Matt. I'm surprised that TheFacelessMen sold the EM400 tripod as he loved it dearly.,0
"Just got my Stellarvue M6HD Dual OTA altaz mount in the mail and my ultimate visual Tak setup is now complete! Dual mounted TSA120 and Mewlon 210 riding on top of a Berlebach Report tripod. Now I just need to get some encoders so I can connect this to Sky Safari on my iPad for pushto. The Stellarvue M6HD mount is HUGE, pictures online make it look small but when mounted, it makes the Mewlon 210 and TSA120 look small..",9
More....,6
I kind of like the little scope and mount on on left side. Hope the bigger duo is held as firmly by the M6 mount.,0
Looks somehow very familiar to me. Yes lots of arm twisting.  yes it was a good tripod and I will miss it....however I am moving everything to permanent Piers and I will end up with 2 very portable scopes (AstroPhysics Star12ED and my newly acquired Takahashi CN212) on Avalon TPOD130 tripods. Plus Matt is under strict orders to offer back to me should he want to sell it in the future.,1
"Sounds good, looking forward to some pictures.",0
"I finally got "" first light "" with my new binoculars last night, and seeing the E and F stars of the M42 Trapezium as my first target certainly was nice. The other target of note was being able to fit the Pleiades Cluster into a single view once again.It was so great to have an upright/unreversed image and with so much detail. I used a pair of Panoptic 24s and Takahashi LE7.5 ED eyepieces for first light which gave 38x and 120x respectively. The EMS-Matsumoto ULS system is a joy to use with image-merging adjustment so easy to do for terrestrial distances as well as Astro distance.... Surprisingly the L-bracket held the Bi-Tak much steadier than expected with no issues even with the LE7.5 at 120x.. The 3D sensation on M42 was also unexpected, with the 'wings' seeming to extend towards the viewer.... More later.....",11
""" The Bino-TSA120 how do I describe you............. the views you give are simply perfect, absolutely pinpoint stars of many colours on a sheet of the blackest velvet background.The depth of the view was mesmerisingly three dimensional with the wings of the Great Nebula In Orion enveloping the stars of the Trapezium like a giant bird clutching its eggs.The multicoloured jewels of the NGC4755 cluster seemed to float above the background stars and the crater rims of the Moon seemed like they were within arms reach....."". After a four hour test session I would say:. The BinoTak would probably match up with a 'mono-mode' TOA160 (not a typo..... 160mm) for image brightness/light gatheringThe TOA150's better Limiting Magnitude allows it to see slightly fainter stars as the Bino-Tak LM is governed by its 120mm aperture and the brain cannot act like an interferometer would.The 'binocular summation factor' works on image brightness, apparent image size and makes it easier to see what the optics can resolve but does not alter the fact that a 120mm binoscope is still limited to the resolving ability of a 120mm single objective.The BinoTak with an exit pupil of 3.16mm showed a brighter view than the TOA+BBHS in mono mode with and exit pupil of 3.57.The TOA150 with binoviewers and Panoptic 24s suffers image dimming to the degree that it it looks more like a single TSA120The 3D effect of the binoscope is very noticeable on certain objects, especially on M42 and EtaCarinae (3372). The TOA (in mono mode) then can see finer stars (those below the limiting magnitude of the 120mm objective) and also showed a little bit more of the nebulosity on M42, but the contrast between the nebulosity and the background was higher in the TSAs. The addition of binoviewers, and thus the dimming of the view, was quite marked in the TOA even considering the high quality if the Baader MkVs.. Another very obvious difference we noticed was how much better a Tak LE is than a Televue Nagler when it comes to on axis resolving of faint stars. The core of 47Tucanae was a white blob in the Nagler, the Tak LE it resolved it into a beautiful field of stars... 'less' can mean 'more'.",15
"Nice, Matt! You've truly got a one-of-a-kind instrument there.",0
"Thanks Scott, but shouldn't that be ""Two-of-a-Kind instrument"" ?. It has taken me nearly 40 years to be in a position to do something like this, my first telescope came from a rubbish tip and needed lots of repairs but I loved it dearly for what it showed me...... The BinoTSA has exceeded my expectations, especially after my good friend Phil and I put the BinoTSA up against his fine TOA150 a couple of nights ago.... ( see post 67 & 72 in here:https://www.cloudyni...noculars/page-3 ) The sacrifice was that I had to part with my "" Guinevere"" 18"" F5.6 to finance the project.....",2
"""Two-of-a-Kind instrument"" - amazing!and observing in warm weather..",0
"Nooooooooooooooo......NOT Guinevere. It’s like a knife to my heart. Farewell my friend, you will never be forgotten. Somebody got themselves an amazing scope..",1
"Surely your bino's could do with a leather strap, so you can dangle them around your neck when you want a grab and go mount free session?!.",3
"Fear not my friend Mark, Guinevere will reside at the Yass site with our friend Joe now as its caretaker, for in return for the great deal that I offered Joe, I still have access to use the scope....... So you can have your cake and eat it too.....  alas, we digress...... @ Mike the Knight, I felt the leather would not hold it so am having a neck-strap made of chain-mail........",2
"Thanks for negotiating visitation rights Matt, she’s a stunner. I know Takitis is a dreadful disease. It ravaged the mind and makes you do crazy things like sell that beautiful scope. Seeing 47 Tuc with a 31 Nagler was truly an incredible experience.. I tell anyone who’ll listen to sell a kidney, plasma or borrow against your 401K. Do whatever it takes to make a trip to Australia or New Zealand to see the southern Milky Way but I also digress.....",4
"Wait, wasn't ""Guinevere"" the one we all side-mounted in Yass a few years back for Tak-Attack? Sad to see her go!.",0
"hey DD, what eye pieces do you recommend for the fc100df?.",0
I used my DELOS and they seemed well matched.  I sure wish I could have had one last view of the moon and Saturn!. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,0
"For what its worth, and I know nobody will pay any attention to this. A pair of CHEAP 16.8mm Abbe orthoscopics in a CHEAP binoviewer with a CHEAP Barlow screwed to its nose, will give sharper, better defined views of the moon and planets than any single high end eyepiece. If in doubt, make an honest side by side comparison on a top class night when the Moon and planets are high in the sky. The difference between an already jaw dropping view through a superlative TMB 5mm Super Monocentric for example, and the cheap bino/cheap ortho combination will stun you in the FC100. So for the price of one single high end eyepiece, you'll have a set-up that will top the lot!. A few nights ago i was using a pair of 15mm Vixen LV's while observing the Moon. It was a bitterly cold night and the seeing was far from perfect, but the central rille along the Alpine Valley was unmistakable in moments of steady seeing.. For mono planetary/lunar viewing, a good ortho or monocentric works superbly. Even older sweethearts like the Vixen LV's, Tak Le's or TV plossl's with barlow will keep you entertained for life.. For lower powers, TV's 24mm Panoptic or similar works beautifully, as does TV's 25mm Plossle and the Baader 35mm Eudiascopic. All 1.25"" fit! Truly sweet! Diamond dust on black velvet!!. Mike.",6
Try solar with the binoviewers. The granulation views are superb..,2
"Absolutely agreed, lunar viewing with binoviewers and Abbe/LE/LV adds another dimension to the view. But don't restrict the Abbe types to just lunar/planets, they works exceptionally well in resolving the cores of globular clusters where many, much more expensive, eyepieces struggle.  I recently did a direct comparison of a very well regarded TV eyepiece and a Takahashi LE, the TV could not separate the stars in the core whereas the LE did so easily.......",3
"Great eyepieces that match your scopes(s) and preferences are well worth investing in. And preferences will vary of course.. Little known stars for (binocular) viewing are the Zeiss Victory Diascope eyepieces. I have both the 16.7 and 12.8 mm in pairs. Stunning 70 degree fields that combine with 2x corrector and/or 2x Barlow for my most used binocular magnifications. On the moon in my FS102, they have touched me with their superb images, both mono and bino..",4
Takitis causes double vision......,13
That looks like heaven on earth to me Matt. Absolutely gorgeous bino.,2
"I must say I am pretty pleased with them so far Erik, I spent Nye Year's Eve at the Mount Stromlo Observatory, and while waiting for old Sol to set and the fireworks to begin, I pointed the binoculars at a distant farmhouse in a valley about 7 kilometres away and could read the writing on the side of a horse float parked there. I could also see a person walking around at a mountaintop trigonometry point 25 kilometres away ( though what he was doing there on NYE is a mystery to me ). The only issue so far is that I need a stronger ""L"" bracket for the mounting....",9
"One last one for today:. Happy Takitis Everyone..... (ooops, I meant to say Happy New Year ).",12
"Good thing is, rumor has it that a person with Takitis always improves upon getting even more Takitis. Happy New Year.",4
"I concur entirely - Matt, you know my preference in EP's - Parks GS or Tak LE. I have a very distinct dislike of , and I am sorry to say, ALL the TV EP's - Naglers, Delos, Ethos, Delites...haven't found one I like, and none were as sharp as the Parks or LE's.. I know many love TV EP's, but I honestly don't think the price is commensurate with the performance..",0
"All I have to say on this post  is that one of the only regrets I have in selling something was a Tak FS102, I look back and think why oh why did I do that...",2
Happy New Year to all!!!.,1
"How is the eye relief on the Parks GS and Take LE's? Not too good, I suspect. I'd love to use all kinds of eyepieces, but my physical limitations (poor eyes, terrible astigmatism) require me to use long eye relief eyepieces..",0
Hello everybody.New Year and new Tak in the family 😊. Please meet my TSA 120 in red black white.I disliked the new blue colour so I repainted it. Do you like it ?. All the best in 2018 !!!Lukasz.,14
and the soft bag - Aurora Lite Bank - it is really great.,10
"Looks snazzy. I ordered a set of those Prima Luce rings for my incoming FS-128. Little spendy, but they are sharp looking and very nicely made.. Regards,.",0

"For those suffering from serious Takitis, this ranch with an observatory is for sale including a FS-200, yes an 8"" Tak, is just down the road from me. It has a FS-128 as a finder!. Link.",4
I think it's a FET-200?.,0
I love my TV eyepieces but I think some day I want to try these LE's as well.. As long as it has some eye relief and I am using a tracking mount.,0
"The ad lists it as an FS, but it is a newspaper article.",0
"I'm doing my best as well. Honestly, my FS-102 hasn't gotten as much use since I acquired a FS-128, but I'm sure the day will come when I'll be happy that I kept the lighter, more portable 102..",4
"Lighter scopes can lighten your burden, which can turn out to be a great asset Scott. Side by side, a bigger scope of equal design and quality of course tends to show a bigger, more detailed image..",1
"As usual the scope lacks the micro-touch extension, which costs extra...",2
But it's in Texas.... not that I'd refuse it as a gift,0

"Takitis infected guys... Does anybody have the FS60CB? I consider it for photographic purposes but also as a wide-field visual instrument. has anyone used it with a 2"" diagonal or it only takes 1.25"" (system chart not conclusive).... Thanks....",0
"I've had a couple of them and used a 2"" diagonal. You could use the Sky 90 visual back and should be OK. In the photo below I had a Tak compression ring which I don't think that is available any more..",5
This might also be helpful.... https://www.cloudyni...q-85/?p=6400214.,0
"It does accept 2"" diagonal. You will need2"" ocular holder for FS-60C (KA21110)..",0
"In Europe, hereor here..",0
Lengedary FC-125. I have to say l like it more than FS-128 (and it's 6cm shorter than FS-128)..,12
Now you just need to find another and bolt them together for visual nirvana......,0
Was curious how many of the Tak 125 scopes were made and during what time period? Is it a triplet or doublet and what is the focal length/ratio?  I have heard these scopes being mentioned occasionally in this forum before. Thanks... Bill.,0
"I want to do my part to keep this thread alive. I'm leaning toward purchase of a Takahashi TOA-130NFB optical tube for visual work with my G-11 mount, and I have some questions:. First, the TOA-130NFB, because of its relatively heavy focuser, does not come standard with a counterweight ring. That being so, is there any reason why I should order a counterweight ring for my 130NFB?. Second, from whom should I order a custom hard case?. Third, which dovetail plate is best for use with the Tak clamshell for the TOA-130NFB? Or should I skip the clamshell and get the double ring tube holder, instead?. Fourth, does anyone have any other advice regarding the care and feeding of the TOA-130NFB?. Thank you for your time.",0
"The Takitis is starting to take hold within me. I can't stop it, not sure I want to! I would love an FC-100DCU with a split tube and sliding dew shield... that would hook me for sure. Has anyone even thought about making one? I don't think you can get a 95mm split tube, only the 80mm for the FC-76DCU, which just isn't enough for the FC-100D. I hope Takahashi drops something like this at NEAF....",0
"If you get the NFB, there’s no need to order the counterweight ring. Even the lighter NS doesn’t ‘need’ the ring, as I’ve experimented without it. You may want to consider the NS version anyway seeing as you are only doing visual, as I do. It will save you quite a bit of cash, and the bigger focuser isn’t needed for visual.. I use a Pelican 1740 case. Fits nicely even with the diagonal in place.. I have a nice BT Tech dovetail I bought from OPT to suit the clamshell. I like the clamshell and it’s perfect for visual.. Enjoy it when you get it. 130mm telescopes don’t come any better..",1
It's too difficult and I think they are too long. I'm hesitating to build my FS-128 binoculars now..,0
"Hi Bill. FC-125 was made from late 1980s to mid 1990s. I think there are less than FS-128 and becoming more rare after so many years. Its focal length is 1000mm, a f8 fluorite doublet..",0
"The TOA130 accessory ring weighs 1.8Kg and certainly is not required for the NFB. I agree with Allan that the 2.7"" focuser is more than sufficient for visual use, saving both weight and expense.. I used the clamshell on my 130S and the rings on the NFB, the rings allowed me to make a decent handle to carry the scope but other than that the clamshell is fine.. FarPoint make a dovetail suitable for the Tak clamshells.. The optics are as good as it gets in refractors....",0

Astronomics has a great sale on the Meade SWA eps.. Clear Skies!.,0
Those are some crazy deals.  The 28mm is an amazing eyepiece.  I'm seriously considering the 34mm..,0
I am in for a pair of 24mm's. Now if the UWA's went on sale like the SWA's......I am all in !.,0
Yes sir. Had to jump on that 28!,0
"The 20mm seems to not be on sale, and is the only one in stock..",0
Good timing. I have been looking for EP's to replace my 32 and 25 Plossl's in order to get a wider view in my Orion XT8. These will work nicely! I ordered the 34 and 24. Hope they are back in stock soon..,0
This sale is madness. They are giving them away.  Near Panoptic quality for Plossl prices..,0
Early next week.  They are on the road as I type..,0
I wish I had a hole in my EP collection to fill with one of these. What an incredible deal! I love my 24mm and would highly recommend one to anyone who needs an EP in this focal length..,0
"Amazing deal, 34, 28, 16 ordered.  I've been using the stock eyepieces that came with my 4.5 newtonian for years now (cheapy orion explorer II 25mm and 10mm).  This will work great for when I get the new scope that is in the planning stages (and hey the 16 will work now!) And yeah I would probably would have snagged that 20 but it doesn't seem like it's on sale like the others.",0
I forgot to click a button on the web application.  I will address that tomorrow.  Thanks for the heads up.  The 20 falls in line price wise with the rest of the line..,0
"Michael, any chance for the UWA to go on sale ? Would like a pair of 18uwa's too !.",0
Not at this time.  The Celestrons or Explore Scientific should fit that bill.  I understand they all come from the same optical house..,0
Gee willikers!. With the Celestron and ES Sales and now this Meade SWA sale.. what a good time to upgrade to wide field eyepieces!. Arizona Ken.,0
"Ok the important question is when are Ethos 40% off, I might buy one when its 40% off??.",0
Same here.  I wish there were some holes in my collection.  Those are fantastic prices!.,0
"I don't need any more EP's but I am tempted to get the 40MM for the price.... What to do, what to do????.",0
Helder:. We'll be waiting for your first light report.. Arizona Ken.,0
"Ken, I wouldn't mind, but my EP case is filled. Just no more space and I am NOT buying a new EP case..",0
"This is a bit of a bummer as I just bought the 16mm and the 24mm from Astronomics a month ago for $99 and $169,more than double the current sale price.I wouldn't mind snagging the 20mm as well if the price drops on it..",0
We were a little shocked about the pricing as well..,0
Looks like they are mostly gone....,0
"The reason for the 18uwa's is that they are the highest focal length UWA's in a 1.25"" format. Strip the housing off and it's bino city..",0
"Once word gets around, things start to move..",0
Michael I just purchased the 12.4mm Meade Plossl from you for $15 + shipping. The eyepiece is better than I expected and is listed at 4oz. in weight. It's a hefty little eyepiece and is very sharp in my 80mm F/11.4 Celestron/Vixen refractor. Thanks for the deal!. Jim.,0
"We have a local furniture store named Bob Mills furniture.  His motto for years and years was ""The Working Man's Friend"", then switched to ""Your Home's Best Friend"".  So in that vein I guess astronomics is ""Your Telescope's Best Friend""?  A long winded way of saying you are welcome and thank you for visiting us and posting on Cloudy Nights..",0
Just ordered a 40mm.  Do I need it?  No...  Do I WANT it?  YES!.,0
Wonder if Meade is unloading them for a reason?   Maybe the 6000 serious is about to launch?,0
"This is just speculation, but when I worked in retail a few years ago (Best Buy), a price ending in50 signified a closeout item. Perhaps the same is true with the Meade 5000 Series SWAs?.",0
I was so looking forward for the rain and clouds to end and now this sale comes along.   Will we ever see clear sky's again.....,0
I just ordered a 20mm SWAThis completes my set nicely.. I was told this sale may last until April.Totally unheard of prices for ep's of this quality.I wouldn't be surprised to see other competitive sales start popping up.. The last time I got something for a ridiculously low price that made me grin from ear to ear was when Astronomics were clearing out Celestron Regal binoculars for $169.. Once again Astronomics has put a Chesire grin on my face.Way to go Astronomics,0
How bad is the pincushion distortion on these Meade SWA?  I did not like the pincushion on the 27mm Panoptic.. Dave.,0
I am still waiting to try out the 16SWA I bought a month ago.I haven't had a good night since I bought it.Now with a 20mmSWA on it's way I fear I will have to wait until next fall before I will get to use it or the 16mm,0
"Can anybody confirm the weight on the 28mm?  19 oz seems pretty light for a 28mm 2 inch eyepiece.  I might pick one up just for that reason, I have a 31mm Axiom, super heavy, a Meade 5K 34mm SWA,,super heavy, 23mm Axiom is fairly heavy...  Would be nice to have a light weight widefield for the Dob that doesn't require massive rebalancing... Here are some specs so you see what I mean... 31mm Celestron Axiom ------- 48 oz. 23mm Celestron Axiom ------- 32 oz. 19mm Celestron Axiom ------- 19 oz. 40mm Meade 5k SWA ---------- 44 oz. 34mm Meade 5k SWA ---------- 29 oz. 28mm Meade 5k SWA ---------- 19 oz. 27mm Televue Panoptic ------ 18 oz. It might be the only longer focal length eyepiece of this big round mushroom style that weighs about the same as a TeleVue of the same focal length... Ken.",0
"I hope this sale lasts for another 2 weeks for my check to get in, and I am SO buying a couple!.",0
Just weighed one to confirm. Actually the 28mm SWA weighs a little less than 18 oz. The 19 oz figure is the weight with both dust caps on..,0
Thank you very much.. Ken.,0
Just ordered the 24mm and 28mm plus a 34mm to give to a friend.  The total price still came out to my cheapest new EP purchase in the last two years!!!  This sale is absolutely nuts...,0
I got to use the 16mmSWA this evening and can say that it's every bit as good as the 24mmSWA imo.The er is a bit tight but I can still easily take in the entire fov.I personally don't mind this but some might especially eyeglass wearers.Great ep especially at the present sale price..,0
"Hi,.  Which would you recommend for a low-power wide-field eyepiece for my CPC11/C8/AT6M?.  Any reviews to read on the 5000 SWA's?.  Current eyepieces:.  UO 7 & 9mm. Hyperion 17mm. 12, 25 & 40mm Kellner from 70's C8. 10 & 25mm Sirius Plossl.  What holes need filling?   I wear eyeglasses but take them off most of the time while viewing..  Tnx,.  Mike.",0
"Certainly nothing wrong with buying from our sponsor, but these are also on sale at Adorama, and I believe they are all in stock over there.  This is an amazing sale, but I guess lucky for me I already have the 16mm, 24mm, and the 34mm.  Of the ones left, I just can't find much use for the 40mm, or the 20mm, but the 28mm will make a nice ""light"" widefield eyepiece... Ken.",0
"34mm or 28mm? Blackout issues on either? Getting a pair of 24mm's so I am leaning towards the 34mm, but ho good is it?.",0
"I don't have the 28mm...yet.. The 34mm is a great eyepiece, it is sharp to the edge in any of my telescopes including F/5 newt.  Of the three that I already own in the 5k SWA line, I like the 34mm the best.  I have never had any blackout issues with the 34mm... Ken.",0
Thanks Ken. Since the 28mm is so close to the 24mm's I'll probably go for the 34mm. It will be one of the few mono ep's I have !.,0
"I get a bit of blackout from the 28mm, but nothing too bothersome.  That is about the only flaw I can find with it.  It's an amazing eyepiece..",0
Is Meade preparing to hit the 100 degree market?.,0
"Alright Mike. I'm TRYING to save a bit of money here.  I jumped on the 16mm and 24mm. Insane prices and FREE shipping from Astronomics to boot! I have the 20mm and 28mm already. I highly recommend these two, the 20mm is to me especially impressive. That will complete all I want in this line-up..",0
Hey Mike I ordered the 28mm from Astronomics today. though it stated shipping included I was charged for std shipping? Looking forward to the eyepiece. Thanks Bob and clear skies..,0
"Just e-mail, or call regarding the shipping charge.",0
"That shipping logic should not be there.  The logic on the seach display isn't smart enough to make the change as it is hard coded.  Shipping on Meade items is free when the item is over $99.  Sorry for the confusion, but as the item is on sale for under $99 the shipping charge is correct..",0
Thanks Mike for the explanation!! I also emailed the company so you can ignore that one. Clear skies. Bob.,0
"The 34 is so big, you can almost use two eyes.. Keep in mind the 34mm is pretty heavy, and requires some rebalancing with my Dob.  I guess that might be why I doubted the weight on the 28mm, just found it hard to believe it could be 10 oz lighter than the 34mm..  I thought the 34mm Meade SWA was massive until I got my 31mm Axiom, now the 34 seems small and light weight... Ken.",0
Anyone know how well the 24 works with eyeglasses? Can you get the full field of view?.,0
"I just bought every EP but the 20mm which I already own.  The 20mm has been such a great eyepiece for me that I can't wait to see the remaining members of the set!. Forgot to get the bolt cases, though, just like I always do.  Cheers!.",0
"How much weight can be saved on the 34mm if you remove the cantalpoe surrounding the eyepiece?. If this sale really lasts till April I will just HAVE to get a 34mm and a 16mm.  That will fill up pretty much all the holes in my set up, provide a nice finder/ dark sky site wide field for my dob, and a whopping 3.9 degrees of wide field goodness in my achromat...mmm..",0
"I measured the ""usable"" eye relief of the 24mm at about 13mm. Eye relief is about 20mm, but there is a 7mm recess to the eye lens. It's OK for eyeglasses in monovision, I can see the entire fov while wearing my glasses and I had the eyecup turned out maybe a few mm before any fov was cut off. For binocular vision use with my eyeglasses on, I need to get up tight to these eyepieces and still cannot see the entire fov. And then my nose is jambed into the two eyepieces. And I don't have big facial features, so there is really very little room for binoviewing. The 24mmSWA is 62mm in diameter. So BV use is limited to those with a wide IPD. I can just make it with my 62mm IPD, but it leaves no room for my nose and is somewhat uncomfortable. In the 24mm, I could not see the entire fov in bino mode when viewed with my glasses. About 10% of the fov was cut off. edz.",0
I'm wondering how much better the SWA 24mm is over the 25mm AT paradigm. I wouldn't mind getting a tad wider TFOV in my f/5 reflector. The 25mm AT Paradigm has some seagulling at the edges. Never considered these EP's before due to price..,0
Thanks Edz.,0
I know who's going to be buying some eyepieces come friday..  I wander how long the backorder will take?  Any thoughts on that mike?,0
"Stock is gone, 2nd order is going/gone, 3rd order is on the way.  We hope by the end of the week..",0
it's a feeding frenzy :dabomb:.,0
Thanks for the update Dr Rosen-Rosen!.,0
Just make sure to charge all the eyepieces to the Underhills..,0
We just watched Fletch for  the first time last weekend...great film!,0
"Wow, what a spectacular sale! I just bought the 16/24/34 set that comes with the aluminum case. I got it for a VERY GOOD deal from somewhere else, but if I would have waited two weeks I could have saved even more. Oh well, I do still have the nice aluminum case for them all. It seems the set+case is not included with this sale. So what to do? Fill those empty spaces with the rest of the set, of course! I just pulled the trigger on the 20, 28, and 40 to complete the set. Thanks Astronomics! I still haven't had first light with the first three EP's. I guess with this order I can expect two more weeks of rain/snow.",0
"Congrats Gavin!  Looks like you made the right decision, hope your weather clears up soon!.",0
And they've added the QX line into the mix now..,0
"all back ordered now. Ordered the 28mm today as that was the only 2"" available... Great sale. Thanks Astronomics and thanks for getting the order shipped so quickly!.",0
"I ordered the 16mm SWA.  I know it's backordered and maybe I could have gotten it in stock somewhere else.  But I get tons of great information here, not there.  Plus with everyone buying it's probably gonna be a year before the sky clears anyway..",0
"Well, I ordered the 28mm today.  I got it from Adorama, they still have all the eyepieces in stock last time I checked, with free shipping..  I really want the 40mm, but I just can't justify it, it really serves no useful purpose with my current scopes.  It would be nice in a bigger SCT that I plan to purchase, but I need the scope FIRST.  I really have to quit buying eyepieces... Ken.",0
"I'm confused about this offer. Some vendors(Anacortes, Adorama) are saying the special price is only with a telescope purchase. Other vendors like Astronomics and BH do not make such a requirement for the offer..",0
Then I guess you know who to buy from!,0
Can't beat it with a stick!,0
You got that right about the clouds at night. Keep on coming with your comments. Welcome aboard!. Jim.,0
"I don't really understand this either, I bought mine from Adorama, no telescope was purchased.  It did not say anything about a telescope being required when I bought mine. Just now doing another order I went all the way through checkout to the very end right before you submit the order, and the price was at the sale price.  Maybe they don't require the telescope, they just suggest it.. Ken.",0
Just ordered the 24 and 34 mm....thru Amazon shipped by Adorama with  no shipping charges.... Price to good not to take a flier.... Bob G.,0
"I know that everyone is excited BUT telescopes.com had that sale two weeks ago. It only lasted for a couple of days. I got my 16mm SWAs for $49.50 with free shipping but after I added some coupons, etc the price came down to $39.60 per eyepiece. They don't have that sale anymore. As someone pointed out already, Adorama has the same prices and free shipping and if you are smart you can get a 4% discount on top of that but I am not going to say how. Search around a bit. I appreciate Astronomics but behaving as the only one that has that sale underestimates our intelligence in some way. They are a smaller company and cannot always offer what others do but let's be a little more careful on how we present things..  Packaging from telescopes.com was terrible as always. They just put the EPs in a box and shipped them out. No protective material. Thankfully they come in strong well protected boxes by Meade. Astronomics on the other hand has the best packaging around. So, it's your choice..  As for the quality of the 16mm SWAs... Two of them and a TeleVue BinoVue made Saturn look crystal clear through my C8 with wind blowing softly about 35 miles east of L.A. Even when using the 2X amplifier. Freaking amazing..  Regards.. DrF.",0

"As I have said before everything has it's price.  Such as Cloudy Nights.  As we don't charge a fee of any sort, allow the companies on the front page to advertise for free, and continue to upgrade the servers yearly, any money spent at Astronomics goes to helping keep Cloudy Nights going and post opinions about products and enjoy talking about gear.  On top of that we offer a discount to CN members with no sort of membership fee that other companies ask for.  In the end we are usually a few bucks higher or lower, but that few dollars helps keep CN running.  I guarantee that if any other organization owned CN it would be inundated with ads for their company and like.  We try to keep the spirit of CN as Allister left it.  So if you felt that we are trying to pull one over, or question anyone's intelligence you are mistaken.. We are one of the largest telescope retailers in the world and continue that trend year in and year out.",0
"You all may read the passion as I type, so I apologize if I come off gruff.  Astronomics is like my kid brother as I have been working here since I was six.  The business is my passion.  While I don't get to observe as much as I would like since I have two young children.  My passion now goes into growing the hobby and growing our store again.. I think finding passion and enthusiasm in some of the other stores might be possible, but difficult as the astronomy side of their business model is one of many cogs in the machine while ours is the machine..",0
"Mike,.  I think I can speak for many others and definitely for myself in saying that we are very grateful for everything you do for CN.  Thanks!.  Patrick.",0
I second that WHOLEHEARTEDLY. Bob.,0
"Three Cheerz for Astronomics!!!. I always find it funny when someone announces a great eyepiece, Astronomics is the first one to be sold out. Sometimes it's not funny when I want it too..",0
"I ended up ordering mine from adorama as well. I had a small credit there I've been wanting to use up. Even though on the website it says the scope is required for the special price, it did not seem to matter..",0
"All these sales are making me broke!... Honey, you're not gonna believe the sale <insert eyepiece vendor name> is having now.. I thought I would never say this but I'm starting to understand my wife's shoe/purse addiction All we need is Televue to have a sale and I will need to get a second job to feed this addiction",0
My post was no disrespect to you or your company. I love my AT Paradigm Eyepieces and other products I have purchased from you guys. I had a credit with Adorama that I needed to use. I didn't mean to stir up trouble.,0
Just an hour ago I showed the beehive cluster to my significant other. I just explained to her how much better it would look in the meade SWA eyepieces,0
No problem.  There was another post it was answering.  The one that said we were challenging people's intelligence.   That got me off on a tangent that I probably shouldn't have gone on.  That's why my dad tells me to type what I want to say in word then just delete what I type.  That way my emotions won't get the better of me and I won't say something I will regret.  Apologies for my rant to all..,0
"Uh, oh.  I forgot about that.  Man, you guys are trying to make this sale completely irrestible, aren't you?",0
I don't think that post was directed towards astronomics as much as at this thread.  I don't think it was correct on either account as I certainly did not get the impression that you were the only retailer to offer this discount either from your posts or from any other post in this thread..,0
"I already got my shipment so thank you for the quick turn around and excellent job packing them! Much appreciated. PS...coming from an all plossl collection I was not prepared for how large that 34mm is, wow..",0
"Hi,. I read a review on Amazon regarding one of the 5000 UWA's comparing the light transmission with a Q70. The UWA wasn't as good probably due to the 8 elements.. How do the 5000 SWA's fair? I believe they all have 6 elements.. Tnx,. Mike.",0
"My 40mm arrived this morning... WOW!  That's big, 44oz.   I hope Astronomics carries a counter balance for my C8.  In all seriousness, thanks for the quick turnaround; it was back ordered when I placed my order & I still got it in 4 days.  I will do repeat business.   Jaimo!.",0
"C-bass:  Welcome to Cloudy Nights!  Glad to have you join us on the forums!. Congratulations on your new eyepiece(s)!  We'd love to hear what your impression is, after you view with them..",0
"Ditto!. As someone trying to keep a small business going (I'm not the owner) in this nasty economy, I have a soft spot for a family owned company. Astronomics is my first choice when I buy new..",0
"If it's the same review I read, that guy would take Q70s over a Nagler any day, so take with salt.",0
"Mike,.   I don't think any apology should be necessary - I understand your comments and I'm with you 110%.  This hobby would lose a lot without your efforts and without those of everyone involved at CN.  I could easily go off on a rant about discount houses that cut prices drastically and put quality retailers out of business, but all I'll say for now is that it is in no one's best interests to patronize these companies.. John.",0
"There are some dealers not participating in the promotion, just like not all are for the Celestron eyepiece sale.. Doesnt make sense to me. Its always better to move product at a lower price then not to sell anything..",0
"Well, I assume that it's only the ""elite"" dealers that are being offered the lower-cost stock to permit such a sale..",0
There are no dealer restrictions..,0
Ordered a 34mm yesterday.  The eyepiece hasn't even got here and already the rain is starting!!,0
"I don't think the CN discount applies to sale items. At least I didn't get one with my purchase. I'm not complaining though, $97.45 shipped is still a steal for the meade 28 SWA..",0
"Picked up a 34mm today. Now I have the 16, 24, and 34.",0
I would love to buy some of these eyepieces...but been in Ireland I'm afraid that the shipping and duty charges would be a killer .  You guys in the U.S.A are so so lucky..  Thank you Astronomics for the gift of the forum and all you very good work with Cloudy Nights..,0
"Just ordered the 34 and 16, I have the 28 and I love it....",0
"Often the postage isnt too bad; but I dont think Astronomics sell overseas unfortunately, at least not all EPs...",0
Depending on the sale.  In house clearance/self imposed sale the discount won't count.  Manufacturer sale a CN discount will apply.. We have specific dealer agreements that prevent us from selling certain lines overseas.  Sorry about that..,0
"Thanks for welcoming me to the site. I have learned a lot here in a short time and look forward to contributing what I can. Contrary to how it is supposed to work I got the new eyepieces yesterday and it is a clear night tonight! I was short on time but lined up the double cluster, Andromeda, The Pleiades, and M41 through the new EP's. I am no expert so will not try to make any technical comparisons but I sure was blown away by the SWA's..",0
You are most welcome; we are glad to have you here!   Don't have to be an expert; the above speaks volumns!   Glad you like them!.,0
How does the 34mm compare to the 35mm Panoptic?.,0
"I've viewed through 35 mm Panoptics, and I own the 34 mm Meade SWA.  I'd say its 90% as good as the Pan, but this would be on a scale where most other available eyepieces in the same FL ballpark rate at 50% or (more commonly) less of a Panoptic in my book..",0
"Too good to pass up, just placed my order for a 16mm.. Best,.",0
"Lawrence, could you elaborate on the missing 10%?.",0
.,0
What about Canada?.,0
No issues there..,0
While I don't have the 35mm Panoptic I did try my new 34mm Meade swa last night and it was outstanding.  I was very impressed.  Sharp out the the edge with good colors. You just can't go wrong with these eyepieces. And at these prices their a no brainer..,0
"Joner, try this:. From what I gather, you can have your own US address, make purchases online, have the eyepieces delivered to your US address, which most likely will be free shipping CONUS from most vendors, then when you're all set and all your items are in, they will take care of consolidating and boxing them and shipping the goods right to your door.. I myself am using such a service to get astro gear from the US but it's a country specific service which runs along the lines of Myusmailbox, it will save you a lot of bucks since the shipment fee that you pay is just one time for all the items, and my forwarding service is via cargo boat so it's even a lot cheaper (longer though, around a month transit compared to air cargo). Hope this helps.. Best,.",0
"I received my 20mm yesterday (thanks Astronomics!).  Really, really nice eyepiece.  Very pleasantly surprised on build quality.  Worked well in a f/4 starblast, not quite as well on the outer field comparing to a 13T6, but I didn't expect it to.  Ergonomics very reminiscent of a 22 Pan.  I measured a 19mm top lens.  Eyerelief a little tight, not bad, I could move my eye back a very, very tiny bit and still see the total FOV (without glasses), I would say the usable eyerelief is similar to the Type 6's. I will try it in an SCT this weekend and compare to a 22 Orion Superwide(which is heavier)..",0
More edge softness (astigmatism) and a bit less contrast..,0

"Just received my 28mm... BIG... can't wait to try it out but of course, the skies are not cooperating. My first 2"" eyepiece. Thanks Astronomics!.",0
Keith. What scope did you use?. Thanks. Gary.,0
"Gary,. I used a SV90TBV..",0
"Just rcvd mine (28mm SWA) its awesome. had a quick first light with my 10""F7 since it was so windy out it definitely was quick. Took a nice look at M42. The trap was tack sharp and so was all the stars to the edge. It was an awesome view of the Great Nebula, much structure, black sky, comfortable eye relief, a very impressive first view. I dont know how it performs yet in fast scopes (hope to wheel out my 22""F4.9 tomorrow supposed to be less windy) and will compare it with both scopes and against the Meade 5K UWA 30mm. Bob M.",0
"I received a 24mm, 34mm, and a 40mm SWA today...and the sky was actually clear so I got a chance to try them out in my 'new to me' CPC1100 (first light for the scope tonight too).  Of the three, my favorite was the 34mm.  The 40mm had a little too much flaring at the edge of the field of view for my taste.  I'm using a Denkmeier Power X Switch diagonal with 2x barlow and 0.5 focal reducer.  The 34mm seemed to work nicely with that arrangement in the C11.  The full moon was framed perfectly with the 34mm at native focal length and at 2x really did a nice job showing the lunar craters and mountain ranges with nice contrast.  Mars looked really good with the 2x barlow and the 34mm also.  So, for me it seems pretty close to a 1 size fits all arrangement with the 34.. Patrick.",0
Has anyone compared to Hyperions? say the 16 SWA vs. 17 Hyp..,0
"That would be a very Interesting comparison indeed.  I also wonder if anyone has opened one of these up to compare the optical design to say, a panoptic of a similar focal length..",0
"I'm jumping on the 34mm when I get my tax return back.  I don't have a low power ep, yet, so this will suit me perfectly for now.  I've seen at a couple of retailers that this price is good through April 30th...see   and   Both of those sites reference that date as the end of the promotion..",0
"Thanks, jumped on it now too, placed an order for the 34mm, $99 free shipping; whew, these are crazy happy prices!   Best,.",0
"I can do that when my 16 arrives. But I have compared the 17 Hype with my Meade 18mm UWA, and I like the Meade much better. Sharpness is excellent in both, but the Meade has just a bit more contrast, wider field of view, and lacks the annoying blackouts that the Hype has. I don't know if the 16SWA would beat the Hype but the 18UWA does IMO. Still, I'm not knocking those Hypes. Overall they are a great performing eyepiece for the price IMO..",0
"While the Stratus (and would assume Hyperions) are quite comfortable, my estimation thus far is that the Meade SWA's are on a different level.  Much more comparable with an LVW or panoptic..",0
"Hernando,. Let us know how the Meade compares to your 36mm Siebert!.",0
"Will do Mark!. Best,.",0
"I bought a pair of the Meade 5000 20mm SWA to try in the BT100.  The Oberwerk BT100 binocular telescope is f/6.2. Previously I bought the 24mm SWA and 16mm SWA.  The 16 eyerelief was way too short to use for binocular vision, even without my glasses, so I sold one and kept the other for use at the scope.  The correction and overall view in the 16SWA is excellent.   The 24mm SWA just about makes it for eye relief for binocular vision.  I like the view and have kept both, but the eyepiece is 62mm in diameter and does not leave much room at all when using two.  I hoped to find a compromise in the 20mm SWA.  It is 54mm in diameter, so will accomodate a narrower IPD.. When set for my 62mm IPD, I have about 15-16mm between the eyeguards for my nose, sufficient for me.. Without eyeglasses, I could see the entire fov.  In fact I could twist the eyecups out about 2-3mm before losing the edge of view.. With my glasses on, I measured a loss of about 7-8% of thefield of view.. For mono use with my glasses on, I'd say I was only losing 3-4% of the fov.. The field stop measures 22.8mm, so the effective Afov is 64-65°.  The Tfov at 31x measured about 11 feet at about 100 yds.  That's about 2.1° and checks with the field stop measure.. Even though I lose 8% of the fov to eye relief, I still see a 60° fov for binocular use.. Pincushion is very strong.  Viewing at a distance of approx 100yds, at about 75% out in the field, the pincushion shows about 6-8 inches of distortion of a 6 foot long pole.. There was very little other aberration.  Almost no curvature (did not need to refocus to get a better image at 80% out in the fov.. Compared to an 18mm AT Paradigm, the Paradigm has almost no pincushion, it has more curvature, much longer eye relief, and I see the full 59° fov.  The Paradigm is easier ergonomically to use, but has a less well corrected fov.. So far, in preliminary tryouts, this Meade 20mm SWA pair seem like keepers.. edz.",0
"Good stuff..  I plan to do a comparison of the 24mm SWA and 25mm AT Paradigm when I get mine in. I had thought about getting the 20mm, but the 18mm Paradigm serves my purposes fairly well. I've been extremely happy with it, and couldn't justify the 20mm SWA purchase..",0
"Well tonight I brought out the big gun for testing the Meade 28mm SWA and Meade 5k UWA 30mm. I used two objects, M42 and the beautiful open cluster in Auriga M37. The telescope is a 22.6""F4.9 dob. I did not critically align the scope nor did I bring out my parracor. I really wanted to see how this eyepiece handled a faster Newt. The previous night It was absolutely stunning the view of M42 with my 10""F7, but what about an F4.9?. First was M42 and using the Meades 5K SWA 28mm The entire FOV was immersed in Nebulous gas, I was impressed of how comfortable the eye relief was and how sweet the FOV  view almost to the edge was (With no Parracor!!). The FOV just seemed bigger then the 68 degree FOV stated on the box. I liked what I was seeing. I now placed the Meade 5k UWA 30mm. It is so much bigger and heavier of an eyepiece and have used it many times with this big scope with and without a Parracor. This eyepiece is really the ticket with a big dob, you get lost in the FOV. M42 is more 3 D in this view as you now incorporate some black sky framing the object. Both views are wonderful. Both of these Meade eyepieces are winners. Moving over to M37 with the Meade 28mm SWA the entire open cluster was nothing but pinpoints of even bright white stars except the beautiful superimposed orange star off center in the cluster. I did not notice any difference in the fidelity of the view from one edge of the cluster to the other, it seemed equally focused from edge of cluster to opposite edge. This eyepiece is performing at a high level. I now carefully placed the Meade 30UWA 5K in and the view was just more stunning just because of the porthole in space view. At the outer 5 to 10% I saw some seagulls, but that was not the cluster, just other bright stars that were in the FOV at the time near the edge. The 30mm 5k UWA is a $400 eyepiece and the Meade SWA 28mm on sale cost less then $100. The view in the 30mm eyepiece was not 4 x better though. I have to say that this new Meade 5K SWA series 28mm eyepiece is pretty darn sharp, in both my F7 and F4.9 dobs. Bob.",0
"Nice report Bob.. FYI folks, these are on sale at OPT as well, and with free shipping.. Just ordered the 28mm. Can't wait for it to get here..",0
Ditto. I just ordered the SWA28 from OPT also..                           Barry.,0
"Hello people,. Did not really really need them but... At that price, you can't be wrong. So I ordered the 34, 28 & 20 from Astronomics. They will complete my Meade Eyepiece case and I think they will fit in very well between my vintage 40mm Superwide & vintage 4000 UWA Set.. To Astronomics, thanks guys for those crazy prices..",0
"I already had the 24mm and 40mm Meade 5K SWAs and I ordered the 20mm, 28mm, and 34mm from our sponsor to finish off the set that I will use.  The 16mm is too close to my 17mm Hyperion and 17mm T4 Nagler to consider, however the only EP I have around the other ranges is a 31mm Axiom LX, an 82° EP.. Perhaps the 34mm Meade is redundant with the 31 Ax but I do use 2 or 3 scopes at a time at dark sky sites and having another option around those focal lengths will be a nice luxury..",0
"I like the 28mm so much that I also just ordered the 34mm, even though like you I have a similar setup with the Meade UWA 30mm 82 degree FOV and Axiom XL 23mm/15mm. With multiple scopes its just makes sense (at least that is how I am convincing myself!!) to do this. Bob.",0
I hope you are happy.  I ordered one of the inexpensive focal lengths of this eyepiece just based on this exciting thread.  The last wider field eyepieces I owned were Celestron Erfles.  LOL..,0
"I haven't read through this whole thread, but has anyone noted how bad the top caps are for these eyepieces?!?. They are the the worst, most nonthought-out cap I could image. A piece of flat plastic balanced on top would be no worse. Pick up one of these eyepieces at even the slightest angle and it falls off. Yes the tapered top of the barrel is problematic, but a simple rubber cap of the same dimensions would at least resist falling off a slight tilt of the eyepiece..",0
"I agree David.  A rubberized cap would have been much better.  My 34MM cap will just fall off if you aren't careful.  I was thinking of some kind of tape on the inside lip to tighten them up a bit.  But still,  their a great deal!!.",0
Just ordered the 16 to add to the 24 and 34 I already received. Is this site somehow affiliated with a marriage counseling service? I might need it...Lol.,0
I handle my 16mm and 24mmSWA's quite a bit and have yet to see a cap fall off although I agree that a rubber cap would be better..,0
"No, but I am the Den Mother of CN; if I can be of assistance, do not hesitate to call.",0
"Funny I also own the Celestron Axiom LX 23mm and 15mm eyepieces and they have rubber caps, and people were complaining about those caps also. Regardless of the caps on the Axiom and these Meade eyepieces, both series are exceptional performing eyepieces and a lot of bang for the buck. Bob.",0
Actually the cap on my 28mm SWA stays on much better than those on my Celestron Axiom or my Meade UWA..,0
"You can always crazy glue the caps on, this way they don't come off..",0
"I wish Meade would list the size of the fieldstops like Celestron, Televue and Pentax. BTW check the price of this",0
David:. Thanks for the comments about the eyepiece caps.  I was wondering if there were any issues with keeping the eyepiece caps on these eyepieces.  Thats a bummer!. Donnie.,0
"Now that's a deal, it's written that you save 50$!",0
"I got my 24mm in today. The thing is massive. Because of my large bridge/brow, I'm probably going to have to remove the eye guard so I can get better placement for my eye.. I also noticed that the last 1/8 inch of filter threads where not blackend. Bummer. Not sure how well this effects performance, but most all of my EP's have blackened barrels throughout..",0
I hopped on the bandwagon and ordered the 24mm and 16mm just a few minutes ago.  I can't wait to find out when they will ship..,0
"I bought the 28mm last week and spent five nights in a row with it in a C9.25 - fantastic!  Of course, I'll never see five clear nights in a row again for about ninety years, so it was well worth it.. Based on my experience with the 28mm, I just added the 16 and 20 to the list - all from Astronomics.. I don't know if Meade is going to discontinue the SWA's, but regardless, it's one of the best deals of the decade.. John",0
Maybe they are going to jump on the 100 degree FOV bandwagon and are thinning out one of the series that wasn't a large seller.. Phil.,0
Well I joined the frenzy and ordered a 28mm SWA.  Of course the eyepiece is on backorder.  But I can wait. Yep no problem with waiting!       X-p X-p   Yep no problem at all!!.,0
"Well I did it again!!  I ordered a 20mmSWA this time.  I did cancel my order for the 34mm I had on backorder.  I decided the 34 was to heavy for my little 4"" refractor.  The 20mm was in stock so it should ship today.  None of these eyepieces have even shipped yet and it has started to rain again!!  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!",0
"They don't blacken the last few threads so that when attaching a filter I guess the paint doesn't interfere with threading, IIRC Bob.",0
"I ordered one from a source that did not have BACKORDER shown when I ordered, but does now.  I fear I may have to wait..",0
"Hi Bob, all my TV Naglers are the same, the last few threads are not blackened either. I think if you dont use filters you could do it yourself with a fine brush and some ultra flat black paint. The 28 SWA is a fantastic ep and for the current price it great!.",0
Adorama and OPT have them in stock with free shipping..,0
Both of them show Backordered on several focal lengths on their webesites as of a moment ago..,0
I not only ordered the 28mm from OPT with free shipping I also got $4.50 back for being an OPT Rewards member so I am getting it for $85.                    Barry.,0
"Count me in too, gentlemen.  I just put some money down on a backordered 28mm SWA.  The funny thing is, just 5 months ago, I was sure I was done buying eyepieces.  I think I am done buying EP's for now, unless they start selling Pentax's or Nagler's at these prices!.  By most accounts, this should be a step up from my current Baader Scopos 30mm, and the price is almost too good to be true.  I remember long ago admiring these eyepieces at the local scope shop, thinking that there was no way I would ever be able to afford something so ""high-end"".  It was priced higher than my first telescope!   I'm not sure what could have caused such a price slash, but I sure am happy to be a future owner of one of these beauties!.",0
If they start selling Pentax's and Nagler's similarly priced you will then see a flood of used Meade's and Celestron's hit the market at even cheaper prices,0
I have both of these eyepieces as well and must certainly have different caps than you received. I have yet to see a cap stay on. The eyepiece can not be put on its' side and picked up with the cap still attached. It's a pain in the rear..,0
"With everyone buying up these eyepieces the Earth will be Venus's twin not the other way around. It will never clear up. It's El Nino, or whatever forever!. Jeff.",0
how do these compare to the Celestron Axiom LX?. they both sport 82 FOV.,0
"these have 68 degree FOV, the meade UWA has the 82 degree FOV. I own the AXIOM 23mm and 15mm LX both excellent eyepieces..",0
I ordered both the 20mm and 28mm from OPT today.  According to the OPT website both eyepieces were shipped today!  So that means some sort of bad weather next week.  Sorry Texas!,0
"I have one, and love it dearly.  That is the 18 mm Meade Ultra Wide EP..  Michelle",0
Yips!!  My eyepieces were not backordered.  Only one was the 5000 SWA but that is a start....,0
I guess it's a case of ymmv.Mine lay on their side and the caps stay on,0
I don't notice a problem with my 28mm. The cap is a light press fit to put on and seems to stay there well enough..,0
A little off thread...I just got my Axiom LX 10mm from astronomics and it was on sale (2 out of 3)...it is a beautiful EP...I love the twist up eyecups on the Axiom LX's..and I will probably not get to use it any time soon with the parade of storms wreaking havoc across the country!!  I hope someone is having clear skies!!.,0
"My 24mm is coming on Friday, and of course we are in for another Pacific storm this weekend with rain and snow! Thanks again CA!!. Jeff.",0
"Still waiting for the rest of my SWA set to arrive. But as for the caps, on my 16, 24 and 34 they all fit nice and tight and don't come off unless pulled. Now my Axiom cap, it wont stay on worth.... cap. With an ""r"" in there..",0
My supply of 'no' power ran out yesterday.  A 34mm SWA in the next batch to Astronomics has my name on it..  Tom.,0
"I bit on the 20mm SWA, the 24mm and 28mm are tempting, I don't have much need for 80 degree FOV or more, so does anyone know of a review of the 27mm Pan to the 28mm SWA? I love my Pan, but I am tempted. Also, how about reviews of 24mm SWA to 24mm Pan?.  Also, Astronomics, are you getting more at this sale price?.",0
Yes. We get new stock about once a week or so..,0
My 16mm and 24mm just arrived via FedEx from Astronomics today.,0
I just ordered my 34mm....,0
"First light with my 24mm last night. Well, actually, it had first light at a public outreach event last friday, but I did not get to look thru my own scope all evening   Anyway- I am very impressed. Take it with a grain of salt cause I am not that experienced, and my scope is only a 6"" f/8.  Stars pinpoints to the edge, some blackout unless I turn the eyeguard up about 1cm. A little false color on bright objects at the edge of the field. I did not notice any pincushion, but this was not terrestrial. I'm not a big fan of the weight or the giant flat top, but those are minor..  I did see some vignetting when I barlowed it (2"" 2x GSO), probably the outer 10% seemed slightly darker. I was expecting this, but what surprized me was how hard the line was at the inner edge of the vignetted area. The light loss would not have been noticable except for that..  allan.",0
"Meade 24mm SWA.... Then, and now..",0
"My resistance held up for only 3 days.  Got the 28mm SWA on order.  It fills a hole in my e.p. collection.  Looked hard at the 34mm, but its weight kept me away.. If I like the 28 and the sale is still on, the 24mm and 16mm are possibilities.  Still, those latter f.l.s are close to a couple of Panoptics I have and it may not make sense to add them.  I'm wondering how a pair of 16mms would work in my SV binoviewer.. Bob.",0
Another then and now:.,0
"I *JUST* received m6 16 mm SWA literally about a half hour ago...... so, I want to first express gratitude, and a wish for safety, for the FedEx guy who delivered the package TIED UP IN A PLASTIC BAG... IN THE MIDDLE OF A BLIZZARD!! (It's still coming down here in Long Island, NY, and we've already got what looks like at least 6 or 8""!)...... And then, thanks too, to Astronomics for holding the price even if there's such a run on these EPs.. I opened everything up, lifted off the eye lens cap, and quickly put it back because at that point, I noticed my hand as freezing!  I'll probably go inspect it in a couple of minutes now that it's had a chance to warm up so as to preclude any dewing.. It's a nice looking piece of equipment.  I'm impressed already by it, as it is about the size of the 9 mm TMB Planetary, and definitely much smaller than the 21 mm Orion Stratus, and its f/l is in between.  And, it came in a very sturdy, solid-feeling box with a lined, shaped cavity to keep it from moving in transport.  And all that was in a cardboard shipping carton.. Now, unfortunately, as I said, we literally have a blizzard right now and it is expected to last until sometime tomorrow.  In fact, I haven't been able to use my scope for (way) over two months now..",0
I hope they don't run out.  I've been on backorder for 2 weeks....,0
I got my 20mm SWA today.It completes me for now.. Here's a pic of my SWA trio with a trio of Speers Waler eye-pokers in the background..,0
"At these prices I would love to own the 28mm.  However, due to facial architecture I just can't get comfortablly close because of the flat tops.",0
You'll probably get yours soon Keith. I just got my order today and I ordered it on the 16th..,0
Thanks David.  Mine was ordered just a day before yours so hopefully soon.   Not that I can use it with all the nice weather we keep getting..,0
"I ordered the 34 from our sponser, I have a large gap from 42mm to 27mm that it fits nicekly, especially at that price..",0
"Mine are still showing on backorder, but I didn't order until the 22nd..",0
If I get a pair I will do the same as what I did to the 26mm Meade 5000 Plossls..,0
"I ordered the 20, 28 and 40 on the 16th and I am still waiting. I must be getting close to the top of the list, I bet its the 40 that's holding things up. That's ok, a deal like this requires patience.",0
"My 24mm arrived a day early on Thursday, just in time for full Moon and another Pacific front with rain and snow forecast through the weekend. I only had to wait a week for mine, it came much faster than I expected. Thanks again Astronomics! Jeff.",0
"I hope you get a chance to use yours soon, Jeff. Mine got first light last night with the nearly full Moon out. I was surprised at the lunar performance. Very sharp, crisp image of the entire Moon with no glare or ghosting. Even with the Moon out of the field of view there was almost no glare. In addition to being a great deep space eyepiece, it also makes a great low power lunar eyepiece too!.",0
"I ordered the 20, 28, and 34mm in the 19th to go with the 24 and 40mm I already have.  I guess if people from the 16th are still waiting, I'll have another 3 days on top of that.  's OK as the skies haven't been clear here but once since the order..",0
"Mine shipped from Norman, OK at 4:49pm today!  Weather outlook cloudy for the next few days….",0
"When did you order yours?  I placed my order on the 22nd, but no news on the ship date yet",0
"I just received an email notifying that my 20, 28 & 40 also shipped today! w00t. Weather forecast for next Wednesday: Mostly Sunny! w00t w00t.",0
"Tom, I ordered mine on the 16th of Feb. I believe Lew ordered his on the 19th..",0
"I just got notice that my 34 and 16 have shipped, come on next tuesday.........",0
"I did own a 24 Pan but sold it an picked up NOS on a 22 Pan that I liked better than the 24. I just received the 20&24 Meade SWA's and after a few nights out sold the 22 Pan, although I have had two of the 22 pans over the past 15 years these SWA's are really nice, so close that I eneded up selling my fave ep. I also bought the 28 SWA and although never owned a 27 Pan for a direct comparo the 28 is really nice, on almost every aspect flateness of fov, er,contrast,detail,built quality,fit n finish, I am very please with these meade swa's and thinking about the 34 next. At these sale prices its a no brainer but even at there price before the sale they were decent enough..",0
"Gavin, thanks for the reply.  There was a problem with the credit card number I entered on the order.  Mine should ship Monday now",0
Fedex will deliver my SWA 34mm in the morning! And the weather for tomorrow? Clear and 55*! Can't wait.. Tim.,0
"Just tried out a pair of 16mm Meade SWA's I got today at Skies Unlimited (sorry, Astronomics; they've been great with me in the past); on M37 they were excellent.  In the store I focused on a cell tower in the distance during daylight through a TV 101.  There was noticable pincushion, I think a little worse than the TV 15mm Panoptic but with better eye relief.  Pincushion and edge distortion through an F10 SCT at night was not as noticable.  For these prices, I think it's close enough to the Panoptic that it's well worth choosing this Meade eyepiece over the Pan 15mm, especially as part of a bino pair. M37 is one of my favorite targets and it was framed beautifully in the 16mm SWA's and the magnification was at what I guess is about 162x, as the Burgess binoviewers probably make the F10 SCT to about F13.  I haven't drift tested eyepieces with these binoviewers so I don't know what the effective focal ratio is exactly, so this magnification is only an approximation..",0
"Jim got an email for tracking  via fedex , my 34mm will arrive on the 9th!! Cant wait to see this big boy. Bob.",0
"Thats great, let me know how you like it! Gotta get goin, my wifes back in the hospital again with fluid on the outside of her lung again, this is the 2nd time but they are treating her differently this time so will see, I just want her home and safe.. Jim.",0
"Just got my 34mm SWA. All I can say is WOW! What a whopper of an ep. Much larger than I expected. Very nice day here, hope I can try it out tonight.. Tim.",0
I am going to pick up my 34mm today at the scope shop!.,0
"Very nice! I picked up the 34mm and it is lighter than my 23mm Axiom. Feels lighter anyway. I already stuff the 23 in a barlow and have the counterweights setup as easy magnet stick ons. The 34mm SWA will fit the same way with no adjustments. I basically have a SWA 34 and 17 now that will fit my scope nicely. As always with the new equipment, it is raining good..",0
"Wow, that is really great to hear.  I had always planned on getting a 24 Pan, but decided to get the Meade SWA instead.  Reading your post assures me I made a GREAT decision.  Saved a lot of money too.. Michelle",0
"I hope they stop these sales soon, I dont have much space left in my signature. Bob.",0
,0
"Celestrons went on sale and I bought a 23mm Axium, Now Meades are on sale and I bought a 40mm SWA...... Please stop and end the sales soon so I can quit ""Saving Money"". I don't know how much more money I can afford to save!",0
"I stopped listing ep's a long time ago, its always in contant change untill you get ones you really like to look threw then something new comes along. These meade's are real sleepers, they have been out for some time I feel nobody gave them a fare shake cause there havent been many reveiws out on there ep's for a while. Its always been about a lot of hype on what TV does, boy Al has one hell of a marketing team and long time rep but its nice to see some competition in under the 100 degree fov ep's.. Jim.",0
"That 16mm is very tempting for me even though I have one in tha focal length already.. I'm going nuts...what to do, what to do...stop the sales! :flexible: :flexible:.",0
Too bad they don't ship to Europe.. =(. D.Don.,0
"I really wish they had something in the 12mm-14mm range though. I bet that would turn me COMPLETELY mad!! If anyone knows, let me know. I'm looking forward to the madness..",0
"I just received my 34mm SWA yesterday from our sponsor (ordered on Feb 16).  Based on the QUANTITY of eyepiece received, including the big box it came in, it's an awesome deal.  Here's a pic of the Meade with box alongside my 25mm Televue Plossl.  btw, I paid the same price each for the Meade and Televue eyepieces.  I hope to tryout the SWA tomorrow!.",0
"Just got an hour between clouds to try out the new 34mm. I think it's gonna be a favorite. Nice eye relief. I could keep my glasses on and see the entire range comfortably. Talk about a cluster buster. It was a great hour spent and I even got to try it in my barlow which was amazing x2. Now to get that 2.5, 2"" barlow to take it to about a 13.6mm equivalent. This eyepiece is great and even without glasses I twisted up the eyecup and it was super comfortable. I can tell this will be my goto piece for DSO's. After the Axiom, it is seriously not that heavy to me. I thought I might have to strip the housing for weight, but no way on this one. Good as is. I believe I really like the 68 degree on this. What a deal!.",0
"I finally got to use my new 16 mm Meade SWA.  Nice crisp images and nice wide fields.  Unfortunately for me, 16 mm in my 1000 mm f/l scope gives me only 63x... and it was a night of only so-so seeing and not so hot transparency here on The Island.  But again, what I did see was pretty satisfying.. I was more amazed at its actual size; I didn't measure it with a ruler, but it's one third the height of my 21 mm Orion Stratus and 3/4 of the width; it's smaller than most of my TMB Planetaries!  And, it's lightweight.. All in all so far, it's been a pleasure to use, after one short night..",0
"Just had about a half hour before the seeing turned to duck soup here, had the 24 and 28 out with the 6"" MAC on M42, the nebulosity was nice and very detailed with excellent contrast were it ended and the sky turns jet velvet black and the stars in the trap were like perfect round diamonds then some hi level snutty clouds rolled in, oh well. Really like the 28swa, one very nice 2"" wide feild ep..",0
"Hi everyone,. I ordered the Meade 34 SWA on the 24th...so I am about a week away? Anyways, I have never seen these SWA before so I am wondering how wide are the eyelens that you look through? I really like eyepieces with large eye lens such as the Hyperions and am hoping these have large lens as well. I really like..from pictures... how the panoptics have really large eyelens, how are the lens sizes on the Meade SWA compare to the Panoptic?. Hi Wade,. could you post a pic looking down the lens for me or measure the diameter? Thank you.. I am also thinking of getting the 28mm during this sale but am wondering if ER will be enough for me to see the entire FOV comfortably with my glasses? ER is listed at 22mm but I hear that the lens are recessed 5 mm. Does anyone have the 28mm that could tell me their experience? Thanks alot.. Tony.",0
"I have an 18mm SWA 5K. Is does pretty well in my 9.25 SCT, but the edge performance is not so great in my TelVue Ranger  or my Orion 100 f-6. I've been wanting to get a 24mm Pan for the refractors. I wonder if the Meade 24mm SWA 5k would work in this power slot. Anybody no what the edge performance would be like in either of my scopes compared to a 24 Pan ?. Wayne.",0
"Tony, I don't have a picture (sold my camera to my brother and haven't gotten a new one yet) but I did go measure the eye lens on my 34mm SWA for you. Its 1 5/16 inches. I don't have my 28mm yet to give you my experience other than to tell you that on my 34, 24 and 16 they all have recessed eye lenses, but I find the ER to be very comfortable with my NON-eyeglass wearing eyes. Hope you enjoy that 34, I'm very happy with mine. I'm still waiting for my 20, 28 and 40 which should be here Wednesday.. ~Gavin.",0
Got a shipping notice for the 34mm SWA I ordered from Astronomics on 2/25 today.  FedEx says they will deliver it on 3/11.  Tom.,0
"Thanks Gavin,. Thanks for measuring for me. I received mine yesterday, Monday. The eyelens is definitely big enough! I reallized it only looked small compared to the massive eyepiece! I was surprised to get the eyepiece so early...was expecting it next week since I never received a shipping notice.. The built quality is awsome. I just put in an order for the 40 SWA!!!   Maybe to be followed by the 28SWA. Did you get all of your six Meade SWA during this sale? I hope you enjoy all yours too.. Tony.",0
We are about to see an over abundance of Meade eyepieces in the classifieds soon for even less.,0
Yea I could not pass up on this eyepeice sell. So I just placed a order for a pair of 16mm SWA from Astronomics for my Binoviewers. I have got to stop spending money LOL over the past two months I have spent over $825.00 my wife is going to shoot me..,0
"Yeah, but is was on sale!",0
"Yea she will understand it was on sell. Its just the other $700.00 that was not on sell that she may not understand. LOL. In the past two months I have bought a Meade 8.8 UWA a Meade 18mm UWA and a Meade 24mm UWA, plus a used CCD camera and new solfware and now two Meade 16mm SWA. At lest I will die happy I just hope it quick....LOL.",0
"Nope, I bought the set that comes with the 16, 24 and 34 in a nice aluminum case from a different dealer. I did get a very good price on it, but I got it before this sale. Astronomics and others have the set (. ), but it doesn't look like its included with this sale. But now I get to fill all those empty spots in the case!. My package should be here tomorrow. I can already tell it arrived at the local FedEx facility this afternoon because a big gray thunderhead rolled in with it.",0
I received shipping notification this morning.  Now the wait begins....,0
"Well the used price is going to depend on the future state of this line of eyepieces. I remember when Meade put the 4000 series UWA on clearance to get rid of them and make way for the 5000 series. Once the 4000 series UWA were gone, their used price was well above the clearance sale price, I know I bought and sold an 8.8 UWA and made money. I regret selling that eyepiece, and have since purchased a used 14mm 4k UWA.... If Meade ends the 5000 SWA line, to make way for 100 degree eyepieces (my guess) the used price will be at or just above the current sale price. Why? They provide near Pan performance for a very small fraction of the cost.. Meade may also just copy Tele Vue and end some of the SWA line (the 16, 20 and 24 for example) to free up production debt/credit and launch the 100 degree eyepiece. In this case, the used price of the longer FL eyepieces will be above the current sale price, if the remaining SWA return to pre-sale retail price.. I don't see many 34mm SWA, for example, selling for $50. I would guess they go for $125-135-ish..",0
Funny I just order a pair of Meade 16mm SWA from Astronomics the other day and now the 16mm are no longer listed on there website. Wonder if they will no longer be be getting the 16mm anymore.  I am waiting to see if I get a e-mail from Astronomics saying one way or another about my order if I will be getting these eyepeices are not.,0
"A ha, the plot thickens. I imagine there is $$$ overhead keeping so many lines of eyepieces in production, and then trying to introduce a new lineup, ala 100 degrees. Its a shame, I like 82+ degree eyepieces, but 68-70 (Pan/SWA/XW) is really all I need..",0
"The event is while supplies last.  We are contacting people about the 16mm if we can't supply as Meade is out of stock.  There might be more available, but if the shipment doesn't come in before the end of the time frame, then all backorders to dealers are going to be terminated.  We didn't want people to continue to order them from us if we couldn't guarantee delivery..",0
"Yea I am thinking the same thing. I bet in the next few months you will see the end of the Meade SWA eyepeices and you will start seeing ads for the new ""Meade SUWA 102dg eyepeice""...LOL I have never look throught the new 100deg field eyepeices but for now I am more then happy with the few 82 deg and 68deg eyepeices I have.  Out with the old and in with the new....",0
Thanks Astronomics I thought as much. Its no big deal I will wait and see.,0
I got the email and jumped on it right away.  I was able to order and get a 16mm.  Beautiful eyepiece.  That one and my 24mm are my premium pieces.. Thank you Astronomics!.,0
Can't see Meade giving up the SWA's for a 100deg ep. What would their entry level wide angle be the 82deg ep's? I think you still have to have a starter wide ep. I believe they  will come out with another 68deg (Series 6000)even if they develop a 100deg ep..,0
I can't say that I don't follow ya there..could definitely be true..,0
*sigh*. I guess I should have expected this... Too bad I couldn't muster the resources to get one of the 16mm before they up and dissappeared.  Hopefully I will be able to get the 34mm.  Mr. Bieler Do you know if Meade still has the 34mm in stock?.,0
34mm are still a go..,0
"There are now other vendors who have lower Meade SWA prices, too.  Just saw one a few minutes ago..",0
How about the 24 and 28?.,0
As of now it is just the 16mm..,0
"I was able to compare the pincushion of the SWA 16mm to the Pan 15mm (though not at the same time, as I had evaluated the Panoptic on another date) and I think the Meade is a little worse; however, edge correction and sharpness through the Meade was in my opinion the equal to the Panoptic so I bought a pair for my binoviewer..",0
"w00-h00!! My 20, 28 and 40 arrived today! Kudos to Astronomics for one of the best packaging jobs I've received. As fate would have it, its completely overcast here today.  I already had the   that includes the 16, 24 and 34 in an aluminum case. There are spots for the rest of the series so I had some idea of the size of the 40mm, but until you see it in person, you really have no idea. I'm going to need counterweights! I'll post pictures of the whole set in the Eyepiece Series Collections thread.. Picture of 40:.",0
Another pic of the 40 showing the diameter:.,0
Wow! Can you even get your hand around it?.,0
"I got my 40mmm a few weeks ago.  It is huge, 2.75 lbs, but the views are wonderful. If you raise the eyecup up to the proper level, to quote my friend... ""it's like having a lounge chair for your face"". Jaimo!.",0
"Nope, I cant get my hand around it.  lol, I love it. I haven't used mine yet, hopefully will get a chance tomorrow night..",0
I ordered my 34 and 20 SWA from Agena on Monday evening and they were delivered this afternoon. Pretty good for a CA to MI trip!!.,0
Mine are in Chicago International Dispatch as of 12:08 today.  They'll be running the Canada Customs gaunlet soon..,0
"Gee, do you think I could binoview with these?.",0
"yes, if you remove the eyecups, and your nose.. allan.",0
"Kroum,. I picked up a 16mm from Woodland hills for $49 yesterday. There was a small issue with my card, so they called me - but said it should ship today..",0
Still waiting to hear from Astromonics about my pair of 16mm. Hate to change horse's in mide stream but I am afraid if I wait to long everyone will be sold out and I will be left empty handed. Oh well if I don't get one I will just wait until some come up on the used market..,0
"Speaking of the 16mm SWA Meade; does anyone here have any experience with it, or could comment on its performance? I have a C11 (HD) and would like to use it for some planetary or zooming in on smaller DSO's. I figure for $49, I really could not go wrong.. Thanks,.",0
"I've used mine once (only ONE clear night so far) and that night in New York, there weren't that many stars that poked through the soup, but Saturn, four of its moons, and a smattering of stars looked great in the field of view.  But for me, it's a low power EP, 67x..",0
"I got my 16mm out last weekend. One of the better weekends with the scope. The ER is tight, but remarkably sharp even in my fast f5 reflector. M35 looked spectacular..",0
"Thanks guys! I figured at 11.9mm ER, I will be taking my glasses off, but that is not an issue as I usually keep them off for most of my observing..",0
"Ok, finally ordered a 34mm from Astronomics!  Perhaps to compensate for all the clouds, fate tossed me a bone, they had a few in stock!  I can not wait.. I just want to mention the excellent customer service over the phone, the whole order took around a minute and a half..",0
I ordered the complete set of eyepieces from Astronomics on Feb 20th. I received them yesterday. Until you have them in hand you can not appreciate the size of the eypepieces. Here is a photo of all of them along with my Baader Hyperion zoom eyepiece as a size reference..,0
They must be monsters!. Here is a pic showing some other large EP's compared to the zoom! Gives you an idea of the size of the meades!,0
"Definitely stout looking!  Beautiful set, however!",0
"Waiting for my Meade 40mm monster too.. Here's the Hyperion zoom with an Axiom 23mm LX from Astronomics:. Best,.",0
Just received my 28mm SWA from OPT yesterday.. Not as heavy as I thought it would be..                      Barry.,0
"Great eyepiece you will love it, very comfortable and contrasty, quickly becoming a favorite of mine. Bob.",0
Looks like I missed the boat on getting the Meade 16mm eyepeices. I order form astronomics then got the word about a week later that they may not have any more so I looked around and everyone is eather out or the prices is higher.  The early bird gets the worm. Guess I will try some other eyepeices.,0
"Well I tryed three more stores this morning and they are all out of 16mm and many of the others and don,t see getting anymore in..",0
"You might keep looking for a used one, to pop up..",0
Post deleted by George Methvin.,0
These last few posts make me wonder...are all these indicators that the SWA line is about to be discontinued?!?  I'd like to be the first to predict a Meade SWA T2.,0
Ok holding my breath I just found and order 2 16mm Meade 5000 SWA from Adorama they said it was there last two. So we will see it if they really have them and if I get them or not. Said they would be shipped out today. If so it was a good deal $99.00 for the two of them and no shipping..,0
"Congratulations, George!.",0
Just got my 28mm SWA.  I ordered mine on the 23rd in case people are wondering where they are on the wait list..,0
Aww I missed the sale! Everything is sold out,0
"CatpianTruss,. The sale is still going on, it's just that the EP's will be backordered.  The only one unavailable seems to be the 16mm.... Jaimo!.",0
Mine have reached Canadian Customs now.  Hopefully they will show up sometime this week..,0
"I ordered a 34mm from astronomics on the phone on Friday.  They charged my card today, hopefully that means it has been shipped.  I have not recieved an email confirming my order though..",0
Now everyone can hand me over their Series 4000s. PM for offers.,0
UPS says my two 16mm SWA will be here this thrusday..,0
I ordered the 34mm! But not from  my favorite site..,0
"Agena has the 16mm at the same price, if anybody is looking..",0
"Adorama still has them in stock. Just ignore the ""you have to buy this with a Telescope"" note, and check out. They are currently $49.50. I picked up the 16mm and the 34mm (for $99.50). Free shipping to boot!  Oops, just saw you 2nd post. Glad you found what you wanted. I am looking forward to getting mine..",0
"I talked to astronomics today, and my 34mm will arrive tomorrow.  Unfortunately I will be out of the house all day, so I might miss it..just as well probably, I have a midterm Thursday and I should study all night for it instead of looking at pretty things in the sky..",0
My second is on the way..,0
Would a 28 Meade SWA be too close in magnification and FOV to my 24 Pan to serve as a lower powered finder eyepiece? The 34 SWA's weight would not work well with my dob otherwise I would jump on one of those in a heartbeat..,0
"I had the 34 in my 10"" Dob last night, weight wasn't an issue. In fact, I forgot to attach the springs and when observing near the horizon (M42 late) until I noticed and the OTA began to move. After I attached the springs, it was fine. Your 8"" might be different but you may wanna give it a try, worst case to can remove the outer covering on the SWA to lighten it..",0
"I used my new Meade 34 SWA in a 10"" LB last night - weight was not an issue (did not have to use the altitude brake)..",0
"Well, I got to try my 20mm SWA's with my denk II's and I must say I'm impressed. Right off, I hit Mars and was pleasantly suprised at the detail showing at 98x. Though, this is not what a SWA eyepiece is ideally for, I knew that by what I saw the eyepiece holds promise for binoviewing...just a smidge of room to spare even using the eyecups. At the price, a steal!.",0
Tried out my 24mm SWA Monday night for the 1st time and it just blew away the 26mm QX I have been using. Now I want the 28mm!. Jeff.,0
"I should add, that the 34mm 5k SWA in my f/4.9-ish Dob performed well. Not pinpoint to the edge, but 80% of the large FOV was pinpoint, then they started to get comet like, and the last 10% of the FOV was not so great. That being said, I can really only take in the inner 70% when focusing my attention directly in the middle of the FOV. I'd say compared to something like a 30m GSO Superview, its 70-80% better in the fast Dob using a 34mm Meade SWA. Compared to the FOV of my 27mm Pan, not as good (then again this was the 34mm, slightly tougher in fast Dobs).. All in all, great low power eyepiece at this price, unreal. I used my glasses to view FYI, eye relief is very good..",0
"I used to own the Meade 26mm QX as well.  There is no comparison between the image quality of these two eyepieces.  Even the most untrained eye would notice a striking improvement when using the 28mm SWA.. The most amazing thing is that the regular price of the QX is pretty much the same as the sale price of the SWA!. (I just took a pic of the ""de-shrouded"" 28mm SWA.).",0
Looks AWESOME! Me thinks the uniform diameter top to bottom of it makes the model the best looker of the series...you?.,0
Mine have cleared customs.  I should get in in the the next day or so,0
Mine have cleared Canadian Customs.  I should get in them in the next day or so,0
Mine will be at home when I get there this afternoon..,0
"For my 34mm yesterday.  Very impressive eyepiece, definitely hefty.  The craftsmanship was excellent, coatings perfect and edge blackening excellent.. I tried it in both scopes, and was very impressed.  Sharp to the outer 5 percent in my f6 refractor, and like mentioned previously, sharp 80% in the f4.9 reflector.  I am happy to say that I do not see the central obstruction.. The adjustable eye guard is very functional when extended25-.5 Inches.    It also doubles as a dew shield.  The eyepiece stayed dew free long after everything else was sewed over.. Unfortunately, due to my low profile focuser,  I have to extend the eyepiece out of the focuser as much as possible, beyond the undercut, in order to focus at the extreme edge of out- focus.  When I use my 2in extension tube from Orion,  there JUST is not enough in-focus.  I tried barlowing it with the 1.6x barlow, but can not reach focus in the refractor.  Also, the field of view becomes noticeably narrower, and the field stop is no longer sharp????? Is this vignetting?.",0
"I agree 100%.  That's the nicest looking one of the SWA line.   I also feel the same way about the Panoptic line.  The 27 is the nicest looking to me.. Maybe Meade added all that plastic so that it didn't look like a complete ripoff of the Panoptic line.  I'm pretty sure the Meade 68 degree series came out after Televue's, giving them time to open up and copy most of Televue's design.  (Maybe one tiny difference to avoid legal action?)  I may be way off base here, just a thought..",0
"Tried my new 34mm SWA in my F6 Mak-Newt.  Stars are pinpoint sharp to 95% of the edge of FOV, and even that last 5% isn't too bad!  I didn't notice any field curvature.  Some pincushion, but that bothers me the least of all.  I notice a lot of you guys taking off the shrouds, but that shroud allows me to adjust for eye relief and prevent blackouts.... I think I got my $97 worth!.",0
sounds like it..,0
"maybe...then again the series 4000 optics (also put out after earlier TV models) SPs, SWAs, and UWAs were all something branched off and newly different in some ways. The 4k UWA was the first 8-element 82* w/ no kidney beaning, the 4k SWA as a modified Erfle made for a different viewing experience to the TV WF, and 4k Super Pl (w/ 5-element same design as the infamous Dr. Masuyama modified symmetrical), for another approach.. The 5000s are similarly executed this way to the more recent TV optics.. Complimentary flattery? Perhaps.  Will be fun seeing a 100* model from Meade",0
"Great price indeed! Right on, too, with the standard use of stock outer shroud. Me thinks the 28mm with its shorter ER is probably less a concern. With my new 40mm am working on a new design ""cloaking eyecup device""",0
"I think the vignetting occurs in the eye lens of the eyepiece, it seems that. the barlow pushes out the eye relief enough that if you put your eye close enough to see the field stop, you get kidney beans, move your eye to get rid of them, and fuzzy field stop+ small fov..",0
"Question - Is there anywhere in Europe that is offering these prices, or is this a US-only offer? I've tried various dealers in the UK and Germany but I don't see any improved prices. As an example, the 16mm SWA from TelescopePlanet is the equivalent of $235 at the moment",0
"I dont know for sure, but why dont you inquire at astronomics or agena for their overseas shipping prices.  I know agena ships free in CONUS..",0
High point scientific is selling on ebay and says to ask for overseas shipping quote..,0
"My 16mm and 24mm showed up today.  Of course, it's now overcast here",0
For those of you still looking for a SWA 16mm Guys take note that telescopes.com has lowered pricing on their Meade SWA's and they have the 16mm in stock @ $ 49.50... So if you were like me and regretted not ordering it when there was stock at Astronomics... Well hurry up and use one of those crazy coupon and get it while they still have them. I bought mine at midnight friday eastern time. And yes free shipping.. Cheers !.,0
"I ordered the 24mm and 28mm, should be here next week! Looking at getting the 40mm and would like a pair of 20mm for the BV.. Clear Skies!.",0
Where do you get these crazy coupons?.,0
"Hello Bob,. Google is your best freind. Type Telescopes.com rebate coupons or type Telescopes.com rebate codes.. You will find codes that give you a discount when you checkout. Sometimes it works but sometimes it doesn't... Yesterday nothing worked for me..",0

"New telescope owner.  I have an Orion XT10i (f/4.7, 10"" dobsonian) and I only own the two Sirius Plossl 25.0mm, 10.0mm eyepieces that came with the scope.. I just started reading about eyepieces this evening, and came across this thread.  Are any of these must haves for a budding eyepiece collection?   Only interested in DSOs.. Meade 28mm Series 5000 2"" Super Wide Angle looked most appealing to me.  lots of eye relief (I wear glasses), 28mm seems like an appropriate power for many DSOs, I like that the series is wide angle so I have more time with the object drifting through the eyepiece..",0
"There is little doubt in my mind.  If you can get one or two of the Meade SWA still on sale, you won't find anything in its price range that will beat it.  Users have stated that you can only achieve better by spending 4x that amount..",0
"The 28mm 5k SWA will be a good finder for your scope but you will want much more power for galaxies, planetary nebula and globular clusters..  Get the 28mm 5k SWA and pick up something in the 14mm to 10mm range to replace that plossl. The 16mm Meade 5k SWA will not work for you, very tight eye relief..",0
"The 28mm arrived at my door two weeks ago, and I couldn't be happier. You'll want to keep the plossls (or get something better!) for closer inspections, but there's something amazing about being able to the see Leo Triplet or M96 Group in the EP, like last night. Just stunning..",0
"hi, my first thought would be to suggest considering the highly discounted  sale price 24mm SWA model and a good 2x (or greater x) quality 1.25"" barlow lens to achieve, in use, 50x (for the low power with bright 5mm exit pupil and 1.3 degree TF sky), then add barlow  for 100x (or more x depending on your desired result for high power close-up work)..",0
"OPT shows the SWA e.p. sale as continuing until the end of April.  They're still posting sale prices, though not every f.l. is in stock.  The ones not in stock are marked ""Backorder OK"".  You may have to put up with a backorder, but this thing appears far from over.. Bob.",0
Thanks guys!! Bob.,0
I talked to Meade today and they are out of the 16mm SWA lense part number 07664. They also said that they dont have any on order. When I asked if they were discontinued the guy that answered the phone didnt know..,0
Get 'em while you can!.,0
"Just ordered the 28mm from Astronomics. The 34 was so good, I can't pass up the deal on the 28. Lots of eye relief on the 28 still. The 34 is my most comfortable eyepiece I have. It gets used the most too. looking forward to the 28. I have my Edmund 28mm RKE, but it is 1.25"". I wanted a 28 that was 2"". The 34 barlowed is awesome as I expect the 28 will be too. Fills the gap between 34 and 23 great. Particularly since I use all my eyepieces with a barlow when I want to extend my eyepiece collection and keep the eye relief. Can't wait to get it!.",0
"Just got my first piece of the set, the 20mm  Ordered it from amazon and got it in 4 days.  Am still waiting on OPT to send the 28 24 16.  They said they were still expecting a few 16mm to be back in stock on the 14th when i ordered them all.  Since it was on back order they wouldn't ship till all were in stock.  What i really hope doesn't happen is they hold off on my order till none are in stock..    I have the hyperion zoom and my xt10i.  So am really just getting started in this wonderful hobby and am glad to have jumped on the bandwagon at the right time.  I would have never pulled the trigger if it was not for this awesome deal and great reviews from everyone.  thank you.",0
"I just order a 40mm from Agena Astro, since they also had some other items I wanted in stock too..",0
What should I get for my CPC1100? 34mm or 28mm SWA?.,0
"Starmix, the CPC1100 can handle a 40mm... want that? 40mm needs a good 2"" visual back without SCT threads.. I have a 40mm and I'm going to get a 28mm before the sale is over..",0
"I see a lot of people ordered the 40mm but barely see any mentions of how good they are in here, just posts about the size of it. Anyone with a 40mm find any major issues with it? It certainly beats the heck out of the 30 or 40mm XW prices!. I've got a C8, ed80, and will eventually get a XX14i. I've got a 20mm XW and eventually want to get a 13 ethos, but to cover the wider end i'm thinking a 28 and a 40 would work really well. Right now everything else would just be plossls and i'm looking to upgrade before these run out...the 16 is nice for $50 but a 13 ethos would make it redundant and it's a little close to the 20 XW..",0
I ordered the 34mm. ETA 3/25 but rain in the forecast..,0
I am thinking the 40mm might be a little too much for Central NJ skies. A little too bright of a background.....not to mention soooo heavy. I was thinking maybe a 34mm combined with my powerswitch I'll get a 17mm too..,0
"I think a 34mm would vignette when using a reducer in a C11.  And since you are already planning on a 17mm, the 34mm seems even less useful in a Powerswitch (since barlowing it would replicate your proposed 17mm).. I think a 28mm and a 17mm are more useful in a Powerswitch and C11.  (Maybe I'm biased...cuz that's what I have!).",0
"Wouldn't think of using the reducer with a 34mm, even the 28 will vignette too. Only the barlow. This will be just about the only single ep I will have as the rest are pairs. 17mm isn't bad, because if I get the 28mm I'll get 14mm with the barlow which is a little close to my 15mm Axioms.. By the way, I also plan to get a pair of 20mm's to go with the 24mm's I already have. Might even use the 20mm's more than the 24's too..",0
"Hi, the scope I will have to try out my 40mm SWA is a 6"" f/8 refractor. Not a particularly tough scope for it. Other comments I've seen around seemed generally favorable in some way or another. FWIW, one person did indicate he wasn't as pleased with it in his 11"" CAT referencing the edge performance. The rather long fl will have something to do with that. My first thought was your scopes may be too light in weight for the monster EP situated as stock. Then again, I don't have an 8"" CAT to better gauge that. More importantly it seems to me your future selection of a fast f/4.6 Dob would best go with a 34mm SWA as longest fl. This would of course be a much lighter model, too, and could handily supplant buying both a 28mm and 40mm..",0
"A C11's fl is 2800mm though, I don't use my C8 at 2032 too often and the XX14i is 1650, which isn't that long compared to the C11.. I've considered buying the 34 in place of the 28 and 40. Comparing the magnifications I use the most in my C8 now to what eyepiece would do that in the XX14i, the 28 would cover my most used mag, which is why i'm leaning towards getting one. The 40mm would be more for the sake of having a TFOV that is about as massive as I can get in a reasonably well corrected eyepiece at a good price. In my ed80 it'd be a whopping 4.5º TFOV. Sure that low of a power isn't useful too often, but it'd be fun to use on some really large objects. The 34 seems to be a compromise on too very opposite intentions (28 = commonly used, 40 = just for fun), so i'm not sure it'd do both of them as well as i'd like.. I'm wondering if the 40 seemed to be a lot worse in terms of it's quality, but from the few posts i've seen it seems to be pretty good like the rest of the line. It'd be easier if I just bought all 3! ugh. Thanks,. Jeremy.",0
I like my 40 quite a bit. Of course the biggest complaint is weight. The outer 10% or so was a tad comet-like. I specifically had to look for it though. My amateur eyes wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't specifically been looking for it. It doesn't bother me one bit though. Get it!.,0
"The 40 SWA impresses on its own. I think the problem is that buyers of the 40 SWA aren't the type who already own a Panoptic 41mm or similar $450 eyepiece for comparison. But I can say that it's beautiful, pin-point to the edge (low magnification so this must be easy) and no visible dimming, in my Nexstar with a 2"" AP visual back and 2"" refractor style diagonal. It frames M42 real well, can't wait to try it on the double cluster.. Reviews of the 41mm Panoptic say that this style (40mm, 68°)is pretty much a niche eyepiece for 10+ inch CATS so naturally I think an SCT company like Meade has optimized the eyepiece for these 'scopes..",0
"Most definitely. Using a maximum FOV low power EP in an 80mm refractor is also a niche application of sorts. If done it would seem most practical (especially with Jeremy's f/7.5 scope) to opt for a cheap much lighter (yet still nice) model like a common 38mm 69* SWA. These seen frequently second hand now often a mere $50. Then again, just to own it, for an additional $75 one could also spring for the Meade 40mm on sale. That is if weight was acceptable..",0
The 28mm would actually be your best EP choice in all these scopes.,0
"I'm not worried about the weight that much, I have some room to play with so I can slide the scopes farther forward to balance in declination and if needed, I have some of those ankle exercise weights that can wrap around the OTA really easily to balance it..  I'd always planned on eventually getting a 30 or 40mm pentax XW but at 1/5 of the price and easily 85-90% of the quality, i'll gladly settle on the 40mm meade, especially if it means getting to use it a lot sooner..  Going by the numbers that 28 is going to be a sweet eyepiece, i'm definitely excited..  Probably going to need a new eyepiece case from harbor freight now, those things are about the size of over half my case!.",0
"My 34mm will be here today   Clouds for the rest of the week, but I have patience and look forward to using my new ""finder"" eyepiece..",0
I just got my 34mm a few minutes ago.  Holy *BLEEP* that is a big eyepiece !  Kudos to Astronomics...I ordered the eyepiece on Sunday afternoon and got it today (Wednesday morning)!. Can't wait to use the monster!!.,0
"Just received my 34mm too.  The build quality is very impressive - on par with my Pentax XW.  The box is the largest eyepiece box I've ever seen.  The eyepiece dwarfs my other large eyepieces, but I think it will be far better after I de-cloak it.  The eye relief looks to be excellent, and no blackouts.  I hope to see first light tonight..",0
"My 40mm SWA arrived today. Hmmm...I may need a counterweight...will report back as to how it behaves in a f/7 doublet. Yeah, yeah...pupil...shmupil, I want my 4.3° of true field.",0
Which end do you look through?!?.,0
"I like the 16mm enough after around 6 months(and thanks to EdZ and others for recommending the 16 SWA in response to my specific questions last fall), that it was great to add the 24mm SWA for about half the price of the 16!  It's my new 'maximum 1.25-inch FOV eyepiece'.  The 24 gives a nice mag/FOV for a C8 (and I hope it works OK on C90 too, haven't tried yet) and the 16 is a really nice match for an 80 f/6 short tube.. But I'm scared of hanging anything bigger than the 24 on my scopes!.",0
,0
"Got in some quickviews with the TV-85 and 40mm SWA.  Field curvature was noticable about 75% out from center, though I kinda expected some with the f/7 doublet.  Eyeplacement was a little tricky, but the adjustable eyeguard helped with getting use to the generous eyerelief. Overall, I'am pleased with the view and think I'll pony up for the 28mm next.",0
"Thanks for the info, have the 34 and 40mm's coming for the C8.. PS. Like your avatar, The Inverted Jenny, have the book, and also a mint sheet of the Legends of the West Pickett error.. Best,.",0
"Thanks, Hernando! I was wondering if there were any philatelists on CN. Actually I haven't been very active in the hobby for about 20 years, but I still have my collection.. Hope you enjoy the 40. At these prices you ought to just get the whole set. I've read about how you collect eyepieces like some guys collect stamps!  Regards,.",0
"Gavin, haven't been active too in the stamp scene for quite some time now; you're right, found a new passion for collecting - eyepieces!  Best,.",0
"Followed your advice to complete the set (have 16/34/40), and placed an order with Astronomics for a 20mm SWA (the only one avail.), and 24/28 too elsewhere.   Thanks!. Best,.",0
You'll love the 28. Mine came yesterday and I tried it last night. Looks really small compared to the 34 and my 23 Axiom. Really great views and nice eye relief. Amazing value for the sale price..,0
"Thanks! Glad to hear that it's smaller than the humongous Axiom 23mm - really good but big and heavy; am particularly interested in the SWA 28, will compare it and see if it can displace the Panoptic 27mm as my favorite EP in this focal range. Will post findings when the 28 is received.. Couldn't agree more, thus succumbed and ordered the whole line. Best,",0
Excellent! I've now had a chance to use every one in the set (I also have the whole set!). I cant complain about any of them. I'm still amazed at the size of the 40. I had so much fun on open clusters a couple of nights ago using it..,0
"That's good to know, thanks! Now you've got me really excited to receive my set! Best,.",0
"Gee, I wonder if the Meade UWA's will be going down the huge discount path like the SWA's have. Anybody know anything?",0
I have the 24mm and have only used it twice but love it. What would I benefit from the 28mm?. Jeff.,0
"Is your barlow a 2""? If so, you might benefit more by a 34mm. Nice widefield views and gives the performance of a 17mm with better eye relief when barlowed. You already have a 14mm, so barlowing a 28 is really not neccessary unless it is for eye relief. Either way, it's nice to have a low power piece..",0
I wish they would go on sale too. I would love to get my hands on a pair of 18mm UWA's for the same discount !.,0
"That was the logic I used when I ordered my 34mm.  Unfortunately, I soon found out that barlowing it isn't as easy as you might think.  When I put it in my 1.6x Antares barlow, I saw that the added eye relief caused the eye lens of the eyepiece to vignette the view.  The field of view becomes smaller, the field stop is fuzzy, and kidney beaning is plentiful.  A telecentric barlow or a powermate should work though, as it doesn't increase eye relief..",0
"That would be awesome! Of course, I would have to buy yet another EP case  ..but what the heck! Here's to hoping!!",0
"18 and 24mm UWA meade. 40mm SWA meade. i can get these from a friend selling them here. he said on my nexstar 8se , the 40mm is pointless..not sure what u can use it for in terms of viewing. any advice.",0
"I have the Meade 2"" TeleXtender. It is Telecentric. The 34 works great in it. Have not tried any other 2"" barlows yet, but will keep with the Telecentric design. Probably a Siebert 2.5x next..",0
"The 40 would make a 'widest field of view' eyepiece for your Nexstar 8, as long as you have a 2-inch visual back and/or 2-inch SCT diagonal.  About 50x or so, and 1.2 degrees or so of view.  Nice for all larger-scale deep sky objects.  For outreach, nice for earthlit crescent moon or Jupiter's moons, too.  Either a 40mm wide angle or 50mm Plossl are among typical 'widest 2-inch field' eyepieces for 8-inch SCTs..",0
"the 40mm is so bulky...maybe i should i just get a plossl then. Im trying to justify getting it lol.. also if i get the 18mm uwa, should i get a 24mm uwa too or is it not too wide of a field between the 2..",0
"Siebert Optics observatory eyepieces offer similar specs to SWA and weigh a lot less for not much more cost.... or read threads on how to trim weight and bulk by removing the eyecup sleeve from the SWA's.. I'll stop there as I'm behind the eyepiece times.  The SWA 16 and 24 that I added complement my old 32mm 2-inch wide angle, 40mm 2-inch Kellner and 50 Plossl nicely.  The long eye relief of those last 2 are not everyone's cup of tea..",0
"I have the 40 and have a CPC800, big brother to 8se. They both have basically the exact same OTA. I love the 40 in mine. I saw no signs of vignetting. I spent about an hour the other night comparing the SWA 40 to the 40mm Celestron Plossl that came with my scope (the 8se comes with a 25 instead), and there was no comparison. The 40 SWA is one sweet EP. I also have the 34. Also awesome, but I think I prefer the 40..",0
what is the 40 usually meant for? i know its low power and wide so is it meant for nebulae galaxies?.,0
"Well, my 40 is still pretty new. Mostly Ive used it on open clusters. M35, M36, M37, M38, M44 to name a few. In your thread where you asked for suggestions I recommended the 34. The 34 and 40 are close and really I think you would love either one. The 40 will give you about 50x mag and the 34 will give you about 60x..",0
Is there any SWA reports in f/5 dobs?.,0
"At work right now so I have to be brief.  I used a 34mm SWA in my 12"" f/5 dob one night last week and was happy with it.  The expected coma was evident in the outer 20% or so, and refocusing on the edge removed the effects of the outer coma.  I did not notice anything major otherwise.  The 34mm SWA compared quite well against a WO 28mm UWAN and an AT Titan II 30mm..  As expected the magnification was a little low for my urban backyard.  The background was a little bright through this EP for faint targets.  The 34mm SWA is a great bargain at the sale price, and it makes a great finder EP.  It is a keeper..  Tom.",0
"So If i get the 24 USW and 18 USW, im all set then?I just need a higher power..",0
Thanks Tom..,0
"I just read on some other thread (senility rears up again!) that the field stop of the 40mm SWA and Panoptic exceeded the opening in the 8"" SCT  and consequently vignetting occurred.  So, your experience is very helpful..",0
"I ordered the 28mm SWA to be used in my 10"" dob.  I have a skywatcher 28mm 56 degree ep, and an Orion Q70 26mm ep.  Both preform poorly in my 10"" f1200 dob.  Will the Meade do any better?  Or should I hold out and get a panoptic?  If the Meade will do well, would you recommend getting the 24mm as well for my scopes with 1.25 focusers?.",0
"The 21mm Baader Hyperions may work better with the 28mm Meade 5000s SWA. Even the 20mm Meade 5000s SWA would be good, nice gap with the 24mm being a little close to the 28mm. IMO!!!.  Clear Skies!.",0
"I have a 16mm Nagler, so even the 24 is kind of close.  I was going to get the 24 and 34, but the Astronomics web site adv that the 34 would not be the best ep in my dob.  Thanks for your insight..",0
My 40mm cleared Canadian Customs today.  Hopefully it will arrive before the holiday here on Friday..,0
I ordered the 28mm last week and this week I gave in and ordered the 20mm. I ordered both eyepieces from Astronomics. My wife is going to kill me...,0
I bought the Meade 24mm SWA to replace the 26mmQX that came with my Lightbridge and the 24 out performs the QX by far. You should see simular results.. Jeff.,0
Thanks for the input..,0
"About to pull the trigger on the 34mm 2"" SWA.   Double checking to see if that is one of the ideal field stops for my XT8.  I only have the 25mm plossl that came with it and my 8mm televue plossl and 2x barlow.   Think this would be a good second purchase?.",0
"If you view in light pollution and if you are older, the 28mm would be a better choice..",0
What if I view in light pollution but am in my 20s?.,0
I'm 42 and view in light pollution with a skywatcher 8. The 34 is an awesome piece. 5.8mm exit pupil and 35x power in my scope which has the same specs as the xt8. I can pick out clusters really fast. Super nice barlowed in my meade. I have the 28mm too. Both outstanding pieces for the price..,0
"I don't have a 2"" barlow, and I know my fov would be a little more 1.07 for my 24mm to 1.25 for the 28, and 1.52 for the 34mm according to Astronomics calcs.. Jeff.",0
"Probably correct in your 12"". For my 8"" the true FOV calculates at 1.94° for the 34mm. I would think the 34 would make a great low power piece..",0
"Even when I was your age, I always found that I preferred slightly shorter focal lengths for wide-field panning.  The background will be darker and with slightly higher magnification the views were almost always better - especially in light polluted skies. Thus I'm still thinking you will get more use from a 28mm vs a 34mm. Just an opinion though.....",0
"For those looking for the 16mm, you can get one brand new on Ebay for $65. I'm not sure what the policy is on this forum about posting ebay links so I'll hold off on providing it. These are not my auctions. I'm sure if you do a quick search you will find it. $65 is a buy it now price. I snatched one up myself. I have been looking for one since I found out they went on sale. Either nobody has them or a couple dealers who did have them are asking to much..  -Mike.",0
Well as is normal I am second guessing myself! I just bought a 28mm SWA and the reason I'm second guessing is the fact that the 28mm and the 24mm (which I have) are close in power to one another. I'm just wondering if anyone else has the 24mm and the 28mm and what use they are for.. Jeff.,0
"I have both the 24mm and 28mm Meade 5000s SWA only to use with my 12"" Orion. These two eps work great with this scope and for the money hard to beat. No issues at all with these eps. Clear Skies!.",0
"just wanted to be the 400th post.... love my 20mm swa, can't wait for my 34mm swa to arrive... happy  easter everyone..",0
"Help! I picked up the 28mm SWA for my XT10 dob and I was finally able to test it out. I was unable to fully focus the eyepiece because I couldn't focus 'out' far enough. Maybe another quarter turn and I would have been in focus. How can I solve this problem?. Thanks, Mike.",0
"I was so impressed with the 28mm in my CPC 1100, that I went ahead and ordered the 24mm for my new Meade ETX.  Even though cheap EP's are supposed to work well in an f/15 scope, this SWA sale is just too good a deal to pass up..",0
"Looks like I need a eyepiece extension, anybody have any recommendations? Thanks..",0
"I ordered the 24mm and the 40mm (and a 2"" diagonal).  Now the waiting game begins.  *sigh*.",0
"Just don't seat the barrel all the way down in the focuser.  I used to have to do this with my 27mm Panoptic in my 12"" Dob.  Not a big deal.  Eventually I added a parfocalizing ring to make it easier to get the right depth in the focuser.. Regards,. Jim.",0
"Good idea, thanks. I didn't even think of that.. -Mike.",0
My 24mm arrived today.  I tested it out on terrestrial targets with my ST80 and my 150mm Mak.  I was expecting better eye relief -I really have to jam my eyeball down onto the thing to get the full view.  But the view itself compares favorably to a 24mm Panoptic..,0
"I have the 28mm and used it in my ETX125 with the 1.25""-2"" Blue Fireball adapter, It works great in the Dob too..",0
I was going to return my 24mm and exchange it for the 28mm but with the 15% restocking fee it wouldn't be worth it to me. I will keep the 24mm and instead of the 28mm I will buy a counterbalance weight system for my Lightbridge.. Jeff.,0
"I ordered the 16mm from handsonoptics.com. Can't tell if they have stock or not, but if not, I'll just cancel the order..",0
"I was really considering getting the 40mm, but it looks to be really heavy. Not what I'm going after for my light weight refractor setup. I love the 24 and 16, except the ER on the 16mm..",0
"Boy do I feel stupid.  I complained about the lack of eye relief on the 24mm.  I just figured out you can rotate the barrel, moving the rubber eyecup up and down.  It was raised up slightly to begin with.  With it rotated down, there's plenty of eye relief.  Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh..",0
Thanks for the laugh!.,0
Any of the vendors still have the SWA's in stock and on sale?.,0
"The sale runs through the end of this month and many dealers still have eyepieces in stock. Meade continues to ship to those dealers who order eyepieces the focal lengths Meade still has in stock, which is most of them (16mm excluded)..",0
Is the 16MM not available???...I ordered the 16MM from telescopes.com which still show the 16MM as being available BUT on order with a ship date of 5/3/10..,0
"The 16mm is on back-order from Meade. Our understanding from Meade is that if a shipment of 16mm does not make it in to Meade before the end of the sale, they will not be available at the sale price when they finally do make it. We may be wrong. Hope for your sake, and the sake of many others who have the 16mm on back-order from various dealers, that we are mistaken..",0
"On ""the list"" for a 16mm but am beginning to think I may never get one (on sale, anyway), and it leads me to this question..... What do I lose if I go with the 34mm SWA and plan to 2X barlow?  I understand it gets me to 17mm vs 16mm, but otherwise will it put me in the ballpark???  Seems the 16 is quite the rage compared to the others, so I think I may be missing something here.... Just considering if there's a Plan B before the sale runs out.....",0
I don't think you will be missing anything at all as long as you use a quality barlow.  It may even be better as you will not be dealing with the tight eye relief with that combo..,0
I don't know why there's a rage for the 16mm. No one has been clear about why they want that one. Maybe for bino purposes or maybe they think the long FL ones are just too big..,0
"I don't know about binoviewing, but 16mm is a very useful focal length and according to this review by EdZ, it beats the Panoptic 15. My only complaint about the SWA 16 is the tight eye relief. It is an incredibly sharp EP. I like it much better than the SWA 24..",0
"Owning both, I'd have to agree. The 24mm starts showing fuzziness last 10 percent in my f5 scope, whereas the 16mm is sharp almost to the edge..",0
"The question is what would you gain- a very nice 34mm, and a pound of added weight? What scope is this for?. allan.",0
"[quote name=""m. allan noah""][quote] What scope is this for?. allan [/quote]. Good point....my scope is GOING to be a 8"" UTI (it's ordered).  It may or may not require the use of counterweights if I go this route.....",0
I really like the 16mm and the sale price.  The 28mm is very nice as well.. Band Hunter.,0
Rage?  I chose that one only because it fills a sort-of magnification hole for me..,0

"I got my 40mm today. Holy *BLEEP* this thing is huge! and heavy! I can't wait to try it out tonight on M44 and Double Cluster, and for the first time since I got my scope the Clear Sky Chart is solid dark blue! If I like it enough I'll be ordering the 28mm..",0
"How well does the Meade 20 SWA work and how well would that eyepiece fit in between my Nagler 13T6 and 24 Pan? At this time, I've got a F7 dob but will eventually get a larger dob..",0
"From personal experience I can tell you that the 34mm does nto barlow well.  It may with a telecentric barlow that does not extend eye relief, but with my antares 1.6x barlow, the field of view is vignetted by the size of the eye-lens (it is not wide enough to show the full field of view.  Also, the kidneybeaning is pretty horrible.. It is an awesome eyepiece by itself though!.",0
I barlow my 34 quite a bit with a Telecentric. It barlows excellent. Meade 2x TeleXtender. It is awesome!. I use magnets to counterweight the barlow/eyepiece combo. Great views. the Meade teleXtender does not add any eye relief. It is transparent. It is ia lighter combo than my 23mm Axiom and barlow..,0
That is good to hear.  Perhaps eventually I will add a telecentric barlow to my line up.  It would make an awesome 17mm SWA..,0
"So what is a ""Telecentric"" barlow???.",0
"Here is a nice explanation - Televue, Siebert, and Meade all make a Telecentric barlow. The Televue is the Powermate, the Meade is the TeleXtender, and Siebert just calls them telecentrics..",0
Thank you!.,0
That's good to know I planned on getting the Meade TeleXtender. My first light with the 40mm SWA was quite impressive. Even under a white zone sky the DSOs I could see looked more resolved. Having a fully transparent night helped too. It was nice to finally see all of Praesepe in my FOV.  I'm looking forward to summer to use this EP to pan the Milky Way band..,0
The Meade TeleXtender is an excellent magnifier!It's my favorite of all the barlow/magnifiers that I've owned including the 2x Televue barlow and the Celestron Ultima..,0
"It's funny, but I don't hear much reviews or comments about the TeleXtender. I have the 2"" version and everything I put in it works well. Both 34mm and 28mm SWA's are great in it. Retains the eye relief of the original pieces..",0
"I would like to say the Meade SWA eyepieces are great. I finally had a chance to test out my 16, 20, and 28mm. I would not had a chance to purchase these if it wasn't for the great sale prices. On my XT10, stars are sharp to the very edge with each eyepiece. Looking through the 28mm felt like I was looking through a window in space and not through a telescope. The build quality is excellent. Pick these up while you still can.. Mike.",0
Is there any advantage to buying both the 28MM and 34MM SWA...I have a C-9.25 and it would appear to this newbie that they're too close together from a focal length point of view to own both.. I'm primarily a planetary observer but at these prices it might be interesting to have some 2 inch eyepieces. Can anyone offer their expert opinion. Thank you.,0
"I used my new 24mm in my ShortTube 80 f5 scope tonight on the moon.  Centered the moon and fine-focused for crater detail, then panned the moon's detailed crescent to the edges.  It went to fuzzy hell near the edges, no amount of fine tuning, even with a dual speed Crayford would bring the craters into focus near the edges of the field.  It still gave a nice view of the moon (centered) and a good view of M44 and M45.  Definitely a useful eyepiece.  I like the wide AFOV, it is similar to that of a 24mm Panoptic, but lacks sharpness to the edge.  I'd venture to say even the outer 20 percent is fuzzy.  I'll have to try it in a longer/slower scope and see how it performs..",0
"No, both do not make much sense unless you're a collector.... I have a 40mm and I ordered (and caused the sellout of) the 28mm SWA just yesterday. It made sense to have those two. As a rule of thumb, you want 1.4x steps in focal length on wide tfov eyepieces, and 1.4x steps in magnification in short focal length ones.. So perhaps the 40? That one needs dark skies..",0
"I saw these eyepieces at NEAF and was amazed at the sheer size and weight of them I would have to re-balance my scope if I added the 28 , 34 , or 40mm's.",0
"I used my 34mm for the first time last night.  I was surprised I did not have to add more weight to stay in balance.  The exit pupil is a tad large in my z10, but it was a great finder eyepiece (which is what I got it for) giving me just under a 2 degree FOV.  I did notice I didn't have enought out travel in my focuser so I had to pull the eyepiece out a bit to acheive focus, but overall I was very please with its performance.  Looking at the Virgo galaxies was great!!.",0
Can someone post a pic of the twist-up eyecup in the extended position?  Just got my 24 and nothing seems to want to give!  Don't want to force the issue till I can see what part it is that moves!!!.,0
All the black rubber and green and silver part moves up. the chrome barrel and the bit of black you see on the bottom stays still. Mine was stiff at first too.. allan.,0
"I finally got around to getting first light on my 16mm, 24mm and 40mm tonight, and I'm very impressed.  Sharp all the way to edge, and noticeably sharper across the whole field.. I'm very happy with mine..",0
I have both a 16MM and 34MM SWA on backorder at telescopes.com. Spoke to them yesterday and was assured that both eyepieces are scheduled for delivery in approximately the next two weeks. They definitely claimed that the 16MM is still available. I'll report back when mine arrives (or doesn't)..,0
"I got a pair of 16mm SWA's for the binoviewer.  Eye relief is tight, even without glasses, but they are superb.

"Regarding field sharpness.. I've measured the 16, 20 and 24 SWAs..  FWIW, this is by far the sharpest across the fov of these three I own..  By no measure is the 24SWA sharp to the edge.  FWIW, it is nowhere near as bad as the Meade 5K 26mm plossl, which I found deplorable, but I'd put sharpness fall-off beginning between 60%-70% out from center and by 80-85% out, fair to poor.  The Meade 5000 20mm SWA has very little outer field aberration.  IIRC, a 4"" double, Algeiba, is blurred in the outer 20% of field.  In the 24SWA, it's blurred in the outer 30% of the field.  In the 16SWA, you can see it within 10% of the edge.. Regarding eye reflief. FWIW, the eyerelief on the 16SWA is so short, I can't even see the entire fov in mono mode.  I found them unusable in bino-mode.  I perfomed a pretty simple test with the Meade 16mm SWA. Mounted in my Denk thru my scope I recorded readings on a scale, to millimeters. After I looked as far into the eyepiece left and right to establish the edges of the fov on the scale, I got these readings: I am able to see: 96-98% of fov - Mono vision, eye to eyepiece without tilting my head 45° to see as far to the edge as is humanly possible 88% of fov - Binocular Vision, no eyeglasses, eyes as deep into the eyepieces as I could get 70% of fov - Binocular vision with my glasses, pressed as tight as I could get. I went to the 20SWA for binovision.. If you do go for the 24mm swa and you do take off the outer shell, and you do wear eyeglasses, be sure to add some rubber or stick-on felt protection over the bare metal housing to protect you eyeglasses. edz.",0
Edz;. The Meade SWA 24mm...wonder if you would have any idea how well it would perform in a C-9.25 or my WO 90mm refractor. I'm assuming (I'm a newbie so perhaps I should assume nothing) that outer edge field softness would be negligible in my SCT vs the WO refractor. Your thoughts would be appreciated.. I couldn't resist the price ($74.50) but wonder if I'll get full field sharpness in any of my scopes.. Jeff Kurtz.,0
"Sweet!  Just ordered the 28mm, and 20mm from OPT! Should be here Tuesday.. Weather is saying chance of rain..  Hmm...",0
"Here's the measurements comparing the outer field aberration in the 24 vs the 20 vs the 16. these values are measure using a USAF line pairs resolution chart observed thru a C6 SCT.  For these tests it was measured to be operating at f/11.  I would guess all would be somewhat worse in any fast scope, although it might be possible curvature would not be as bad.. This test is pretty simple.  Record the best resolution at the center.  Then move the scope so the target is at 60% out from center and without touching focus record the best resolution again.  Do this also at 80%.  Then refocus at 60% out to get the best possible.  The difference between the best refocused at 60 and the center is the residual.  The difference between the not refocused at 60 and refocused best at 60 is the curvature.  Repeat at 80% out.. the 24SWA has. at 60% out 1.26 arcsec curvature and 0.24 arcsec residual aberration that cannot be focused out. at 80% out 2.70 arcsec curvature and 0.80 arcsec residual. the 20SWA has. at 60% out 0.44 arcsec curvature and 0.19 arcsec residual. at 80% out 0.89 arcsec curvature and 0.63 arcsec residual. the 16SWA has. at 60% out 0.36 arcsec curvature and 0.14 arcsec residual. at 80% out 0.39 arcsec curvature and 0.30 arcsec residual. The relationship between these will translate pretty much directly to stellar observations (see the observation of Algeiba noted above).. Curvature in the 24SWA at 60% out is ~4 times worse than the 16SWA (1.26 vs 0.36)  and at 80% out (2.70 vs 0.39) it is ~7 times worse (although it's still not real bad,  the 5K 26mm pl would be 10-15 times worse).  Curvature can be focused out, although in practice most of us do not refocus on objects at 60% or 80% out. The residual aberration is what is left over after you focus out the curvature.  It is a combination of probably astigmatism, coma and spherical aberration. Notice all three have very low residual aberrtion at 60% out (0.14 vs 0.19 vs 0.24), but at 80% out it doubles from the 16 to the 20 (0.30 vs 0.63) and it nearly triples from the 16 to the 24 (0.30 vs 0.8).. I don't doubt that the real values would change for some other test scope.  I do doubt that the relative errors with respect to each other would change.. So as you can see, comments that the 24SWA are sharp to the edge are simply untested and real values show quite a different result.  The 16SWA is by far the best of the three.. I would expect the performance in the C9.25 to be similar to my C6.. edz.",0
"It might be less in the C9.25 but the same in the C8, I hope you figured in anywere from 10 to 15% coma with the sct design to begin with. Try using a good rumak designed MCT those figures just might improve. I have the 20,24&28 and from what I have seen in a mac only the 28 might be effected in the last 5-10%, judging by the two stars that are right next to M13. I had a C8 and it was never as flat as the mac was, havent looked threw the new EDGE HD's but reports are there vastly improved..",0
"Now I fear I've just purchased a 24mm *BLEEP*!!!  That's what I get for chasing a good deal, I suppose.....",0
"Nah- you'll be happy. EdZ is really, really picky allan.",0
"I know in my 24mm, I don't notice any funkiness until the last 10 percent to the edge or so. Compared to my 32mm plossl and 24mm paradigm, its much better..",0
"If he was going to really test these ep's out do it on a scope that is know to have a flat FOV in its design, not one that does have coma at the edge to begin with. Just because a sct is F10 doesnt mean its gonna be flat, why do you think celestron came up with the EDGE HD scope..",0
"BTW I have nothing against SCT's I'll be buyinga C9.25 this weekend but like Clint says ""a mans gotta know his limitations""   I crack myself up.....",0
Thanks for the response. I just bought a Meade 2X teleXtender...wonder if image performance will actually improve by bringing the SWA 24mm down to 12mm for use in my WO Megrez 90 (which has the ability to take lots of power)..,0
"Here's a sampling of how the 16SWA performs in some different scopes.  Yes two of them are similar SCTs.  But note the differences.  You get to compare them to the TMB80.   Please note, the 16SWA has the least aberration of the three (24, 20 and 16)..  FWIW, I have a pair of the 24SWAs.  I like em.  Just pointing out, they are not without aberration.  I bought the pair to use in my BT100.  They show outer field aberration pretty clearly in that f/6 binocular telescope.  in the C6 f/11. the 16SWA has at 60% out 0.36 arcsec curvature and 0.14 arcsec residual, 0.50 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 0.39 arcsec curvature and 0.30 arcsec residual 0.69 arcsec total aberration  In a C5  f/11. the 16SWA has at 60% out 0.17 arcsec curvature and 0.28 arcsec residual, 0.50 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 0.72 arcsec curvature and 0.45 arcsec residual, 1.08 arcsec total aberration   In a TMB SS80 f/6.3. the 16SWA has at 60% out 0.34 arcsec curvature and 0.30 arcsec residual, 0.64 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 0.38 arcsec curvature and 0.64 arcsec residual, 1.02 arcsec total aberration.",0
"No problems with the 24 in my Lightbridge, I think you made a good choice!. Jeff.",0
"Just got a e-mail from hayneedle, my 16swa was suppose to be here by the 20th of this month. They just moved it to 5/21.. I get a feeling of the infamous, oops lost your order, now it's $99.00..",0
"How fast is that 80TMB, you have now standard of reference, now if you were using a F10 to F12 APO I would not say a word, I am sorry EdZ the scopes that you are testing them in have other issues and these issues are documented..",0
"Oh well, sorry you don't like the results.. I'm using scopes that lot's of people around here use.  And I don't own 25 different scopes, so I can only use what I have.  But it's a pretty fair bet that they will perform the same in the scopes I use as they will for anyone else that owns these scopes or scopes similar.  I think the choice of the TMB was helpful to answer the question that was asked of me in a post up above.  So while I can't seem to please everyone, at least I can provide info to the people who want to use it.. Perhaps you have some scopes that are dramatically different and you could do the same?  People would appreciate the info.  I kinda doubt anyone will say the scopes you used aren't anything I like to use, so your data doesn't provide any useful information to me.. edz.",0
"Anyone considering the 24, get it. I had mine out last night and loved it in my C8..",0
"From MY interpretation from reading the post above by skyjim.... Why when someone tries to help out, one person has to find fault?  I truly appreciate EdZ's reports, and found them useful in purchasing a few SWA's!",0
"I dont find fault with the results just add that the scopes Edz did the testing on has its own coma issues, let the facts be facts, its not always the EP sometimes its the scope that does not have a true flat feild so you might want to add that to the mix..",0
I like the 24mm in a C8 also...   Good value..,0
"Well, hopefully the 24mm will work well in my C9.25. I should have my head examined as I finally broke down and bought the 40mm and hope to use my 2 inch 2X telextender (beautiful piece of kit) to get higher power views. I don 't need this eyepiece BUT I'm suffering from bargain-think and caved in this morning. There is something about a large eyepiece I couldn't resist. I think I'm being controlled by powerful, irrational outside forces..",0
"The off-axis aberration of the 24mm Meade SWA in five different scopes.  Here's a broader look at the 24SWA.  Yes, it varies from one scope to another.  Yes there is more curvature and more residual aberration in the SCT scopes.  There's somewhat less in the C5 than in the C6.  There's also somewhat less aberration in the f/6.3 TMB80 than there is in the f/8.6 TV102.  There is considerably more in the BT100 than the other higher quality refractors..  You'd have to be viewing something pretty small at 60% out in the TMB80 or TV102 for the aberration to make much difference.  But by 80% out in the TV102 Airy disks will be twice normal size (add these aberrations to the minimum size Airy disk).  In the C5 both curvature and total aberration is about double that of the TV102.  In the C6, it's nearly the same as the C5 at 60% out, but gets worse by 80% out.  The C6 would have trouble with a 5"" double star at 80% out.   At 80% out in the BT100, the test target is 5.5 arcseconds.  Based on other test comparisons from daylight target to double stars, that indicates a star such as Gamma Delphinus 9.6"", would not be visible as two stars at 80% out.  For comparison, a 20mm TV plossl can see a 7"" pair right out to within a few seconds of the edge.  That's a sharp edge..  How sharp this eyepiece appears is very much dependant on the type of scope you use.  This is probably a pretty good sample of scopes.  Sorry, no newts..  Just as it is apparent when using this eyepiece in the SCTs that aberration is greater, it is probably just as important when people say  ""it is sharp to the edge"", they recognize that is relative to their scope.  Here the behavior is somewhat or dramatically different in all five scopes.  The wise choice is to look at results that are from a scope similar to yours and choose accordingly..  FWIW, this is an acceptable pair for binovision in the realativly fast BT100.  Plossls provide a much sharper view, but this provides a wider view without too much more aberration..   in the C6 f/11 at 60% out 1.26 arcsec curvature and 0.24 arcsec residual. 1.50 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 2.70 arcsec curvature and 0.80 arcsec residual, 3.50 arcsec total aberration.  in the C5 f/11 at 60% out 0.98 arcsec curvature and 0.49 arcsec residual. 1.47 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 1.57 arcsec curvature and 0.96 arcsec residual, 2.53 arcsec total aberration.  in a TMB SS80 f/6.3  Apo. at 60% out 0.10 arcsec curvature and 0.55 arcsec residual, 0.65 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 0.15 arcsec curvature and 0.65 arcsec residual, 0.80 arcsec total aberration.  in a TV102 f/8.6 Apo. at 60% out 0.53 arcsec curvature and 0.16 arcsec residual, 0.69 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 0.80 arcsec curvature and 0.45 arcsec residual, 1.25 arcsec total aberration.  in an Oberwerk BT100 f/6.2 semi-apo binocular telescope using binovision. at 60% out 0.54 arcsec curvature and 0..47 arcsec residual, 1.01 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 1.12 arcsec curvature and 0.47 arcsec residual, 1.59 arcsec total aberration.  Hope you find this useful..  edit - added test in C8 - wasn't expecting these results, but just goes to show how much this varies from scope to scope..  in the C8 with GSO Crayford focuser and 2"" diagonal = f/12 at 60% out 0.30 arcsec curvature and 0.25 arcsec residual. 0.55 arcsec total aberration at 80% out 0.30 arcsec curvature and 0.40 arcsec residual, 0.70 arcsec total aberration.  turns out that this eyepiece in the C8 has the least amount of aberration of all these scopes tested..",0
"- ditto -. Best,.",0
"You can say that again; I don't need any of the SWA's but for similar reasons, I bought the entire 16/20/24/28/34/40mm line! Best,.",0
"Dont worry about it Jeff, I had used the 24mm allot in my C8 just before I sold it and use it allot in my 6""MCT. I dont observe close to the edge and even when lets say a planet drifts out that way it wasnt bad at all, even with dso's like m12 and the two ajoining stars on each side, no blaoting or cometails. I am picking up a C9.25 but it wont be till this week, I dont think it will bother the C9.25 as I do belive it uses a slower primary and larger secondary which might give it somewhat flater feild. Most of the sct's before meades AFC system or celestrons edge HD's system do have some form of coma but its not like a F5 dob and from what I have seen less than most 8"" F6 dobs and depending on how old your eye's are will determin if it bothers you and beleive me its nowere near sever like it is on fast newts. From what I have seen it like the last 10% of the FOV and most people dont even look for it cause its not a big deal and I think like most folks observing with 75% of the fov for most targets.. BTE I almost went to pull the triger on the 34 at neaf but its size kinda startled me so I ended up with a AT Titan II 35 but I have the 28mm SWA and its fantastick very close to a buddys 27 Pan,. Jim.",0
Well after all this time I finally melted and just ordered the 34mm from Astronomics..,0
"I have now ordered the Meade 2"" TeleXtender Barlow to go with my 40mm & 28mm SWAs. That way I wont need the 16mm SWA..",0
Surely..... The Meade ULTRA Wide sale will begin in a few days....,0
If it becomes true I am eyeing the 4.7mm UWA..,0
"I picked up the 4.7 meade UWA 5K and its real nice, less blackout than the 5T6 Nag and longer ER..",0
"Oh ya, if it is true there are atleast a couple I would be extremely interested in.  I am very impressed at the quality of the eyepieces that come out of this chinese manufacturer..",0
"I got my hands on a 16mm SWA yesterday, and I'm impressed so far with it. It's quite heavy for it's physical size.. I'm now looking for the 24mm SWA and possibly the 34mm SWA as well...",0
The 16 and the 20mm are really very nice eyepieces.  Hard to believe they've been out there all this time and didn't get the attention they deserve until this sale.  Makes you wonder how many other gems are still not being noticed..  John.,0
plenty of people noticed the UWAs and posted about them. they just dont get much attention because they're not super expensive and dont have [enter brand here] in the title..,0
"Mine came in Tuesday from OPT!   Typical clouds and rain after an astronomy purchase, so no testing for me... Wish I could have bought the 16mm too, but of course, there sold out...  So, Question...  How does the 16mm Meade SWA compair to the 17mm Hyperion??  Anyone have a thought on that?. Should I just wait until the 16mm goes off sale, and snag it for $100?.",0
"From the retailer that I had placed an order for a 24 and 34mm:. ------. Unfortunately, we have just been informed by Meade that they will not be producing the Meade 24mm Series 5000 SWA. in the foreseeable future, though they have not officially discontinued the eyepiece. ------. Looks like Meade are clearing stock out and stopping production.. Series 6000 eyepieces anyone?.",0
Did you try another vendor for the 24mm?.,0
"Well who is the retailer Cathal?? Depending on that, we can decide if the statement is credible..  If it's Telescopes.com saying it, I don't trust the statement. But if it's Agena or Astronomics or Adorama, then it sounds like those eyepieces are practically discontinued, perhaps not officially until they announce a new series..",0
Looks like Adorama still has the 24mm in stock and on sale and Astronomics still has the sale price but backordered..,0
"That may be in a very long time since my local vendor told me that Meade will not be filling more backorders and he now has to cancel on his customers. I was able to pick up an 8.8 UWA, though.  Very excited to try it out--although I'll be pretty bent out of shape if it drops in price in May!. --6th0.",0
Last day of sale? Just ordered a pair of 20mm SWA's for my Denk Standard. I hate pressure sales.,0
"Really!?  I was struck by how small and light it was, for a 16 mm eyepiece.  It is smaller than a 9 mm I have!.",0
"Between OPT and Telescopes.com they have everything except the 16mm in stock as of last night. My club ordered a 20 and 24, but we haven't been able to find a 16. Hopefully some of the people who dislike them try to sell them soon!",0
"Good luck! I sold the 24mm SWA, but I'm keeping the 16mm. It's fabulous.",0
"It was OPT, and the 24mm was cancelled from the order. I did go elsewhere for the 24mm.. I would have been silly not to have jumped on this sale especially when I was in the market for eyepieces anyway..",0
"Big order houses know if and when they can fill the back-orders they take.  If they have a scheduled shipment on track with Meade, they will take the orders to sell the eyepieces.  I just ordered 2-each of the 16, 20, 24, 28 and 34mm SWA for my binoscope.  I'll strip the outer sleeves off the 24, 28 and 34 to make them binoscope-friendly.  I placed my order with OpticsPlanet and got an extra 5% off with coupon code opiv5of -- $736.25 for 10 SWA eyepieces, shipped to Kansas with a due in stock date of May 12. We'll see... I don't really need any of these, but if they come through - great.  It is my first order with OpticsPlanet..",0
p.s. The sale appears to still be on as of this moment at most websites which offer them.  I placed my large order earlier today..,0
"Don't count on it though, I placed an order for a eyepiece on sale by the manufacturer, 1 day past when the sale said it ended but the prices were still advertised on the vendor's site. I asked them if i'd be able to get the advertised sale still and they said yes. A few days later I got an email saying the manufacturer wouldn't honor it..",0
"I would like to get in on this sale, but I am not finding the particulars on the Astronomics website. Which Meades are on sale? Wide or super wide? In what lengths? How much off? Which are the best?.",0
Astronomics now shows the full price on their site...it appears the sale is truly over. I've got a 16mm on backorder with Telescopes.com and they told me yesterday that they fully expect to get more of the Meade 16mm SWA...we'll see...they show the shipping date as June 17th..,0
"Thanks Zeldaboy - Point well taken.  It's true that orders today may not be honored -- best to phone in and only order what they can ship from stock, I'm guessing.. For myself, I originally placed my order yesterday, but had them cancel it solely for the reason that I could apply a coupon to the order.  So, my order was actually from yesterday, legal-wise.  At any rate, I was told my eyepieces are expected to arrive to the warehouse on May 11, as I recall.  We'll see.  Personally, if they come through, fine.  If not, I'll not cry too much.  Not sure I'll even like any of them, but hope I'll be surprised in my 8"" f/12 binoscope.",0
Is the Meade SWA sale price saga truly over?,0
"Hi Albie,. OpticsPlanet.com is still showing the sale prices and they are open today, as well..",0
Did you really sell the 24 mm?  You didn't like it?.,0
Post deleted by E_Look.,0
"Just checked with OpticsPlanet.com on my rather large SWA order placed recently.  I was told they are expecting a very large replenishment order of SWAs to arrive on about May 14 and my order would be shipped shortly thereafter. It may not be too late for some others to get in on this.  My order is for two of each: 16, 20, 24, 28 and 34mm SWA for binoscope use.  (enough to keep us busy for awhile just testing them out!).",0
"We received an email from Meade today concerning the QX/SWA eyepiece sale. Here is the relevant portion copied directly from Meade's email:. ""As of April 30th, the QX / SWA eyepiece promotion has ended.. Effective immediately, all QX / SWA eyepiece backorders will be cancelled.. Due to unforeseen circumstances, our suppler for QX and SWA eyepieces is no longer able to provide these. products. Therefore, we are announcing the discontinuation of these eyepieces. We apologize for any. inconvenience this may have caused."". A few focal lengths are still available from Meade in limited quantities, and dealers should be able to purchase them for a little while longer, but according to Meade any eyepiece focal length not specifically mentioned below would appear to be no longer available if a dealer does not physically have it in stock at the current time.. Available eyepieces include: 15mm, 20mm, 30mm QX series; 24mm, 34mm, 40mm Super Wide.. Sorry to break the bad news, but from Meade's email today, if a dealer doesn't have it in stock right now, and it's not one of the six eyepieces above, it looks like it's gone forever..",0
"Frebie,. Well, your post certainly explains why there was a sale in the first place -- the QX and SWA are being discontinued.  No room to complain at those prices, however.  This also explains why alot of sites still have the sale prices on -- they will likely stay on sale until all inventory is gone.  They can hardly raise prices in good conscience back up to retail on a discontinued item which won't have proper warranty support due to lack of replacements for warranty claims.. I found other dealers who have most of the SWA line in stock and on sale.  I may just place another order with them just to be sure I get a few pairs.. Back-order cancellations -- WOW - Meade sold more than expected, it seems..",0
"I just ordered the 4000 series 36mm QX from telescopes.com (not orion telescope.com). and they were still on sale, as well as the 5000 swa's.",0
"I take that back, looks like they only the have 20mm and 40mm swa's left in the 5000 series.",0
Thanks for the info Frebie.Maybe I will get my back ordered 34mm from Astronomics after all if they can still get it..,0
"So, it's over. Glad I got mine in time. Now I'd like to know what's taking so long for Celestron to fill   ep backorders..",0
So this now poses the question: what is Meade replacing this line with and when?.,0
This sale has been an eye-opener and fun doing comparisons: figured I'd spent enough on eyepieces that end up being duds.. Their 16 and 20 put Meade back into serious optics in my opinion..,0
"Hmmmm - good question.  From what others have implied as being the reasons why these lines are being dropped - both QX and SWA! -- reason being lack of profitability in this range of 70ish degree eyepieces, it seems they will NOT be replaced with anything!  The new line-up will jump from super plossl direct to ultra wides.  A huge jump in both performance and price.  I suspect the SWA were nearly as expensive to produce as the UWA, but the market would no longer support a high enough price on the SWA to keep it in production.  It's kind of funny, really.  It wasn't that long ago when 68 degrees AFOV with great correction and few abberations was considered very special.  Some will say they actually prefer the performance of some SWA over the UWA, but most seem to bypass the SWA and go from plossl/orthoscopic to UWA.  Still, I think the SWA will be missed by some and coveted by others who appreciate what they can do very well -- giving near orthoscopic sharpness, brightness and contrast over a wider field.. If anyone has any intelligence to fill us in more completely, please let us know....",0
a well done 70 is all I want - moving my head around is not tranquility.,0
"There is real demand for the 68-70° EPs from a subset of viewers:. For the eyeglass wearer, or more accurately: those with astigmatism, there are very few well-corrected eyepieces wider than 70° that we can use.  T4 Naglers and a few in the 28-31mm range, that's it.  I really wanted the 26mm T5 Nagler but not even close to enough ER.. So that leaves us with 68-70° LER options at various price levels with various levels of good to great correction:. Pentax XWs. Panoptics (long ER only the longest focal lengths). Meade 5K SWAs (long ER on 24mm+). Hyperions/Stratus. Celestron Ultima LX? (anyone?). Orion Expanse 6 & 9mm (and clones). Unfortunately we apparently just lost a very good and affordable option in the Meade 5K SWAs.  I bought the 24mm at a small discount as PATS 2 years ago and love it for it's ER which the 24 Pan does not have.. I picked up the rest of 20-40mm range for the ER during this sale and my only very minor regret may be not picking up another 24mm for use in a second scope or possible future binoviewing.  I think the 24 & 28mm may command a premium on the used market in the years to come....",0
I have found the entire range that I picked up during the sale (except the  back ordered 16mm which I will likely not see) are fantastic eyepieces...every single one perform beautifully in my C9.25...I feel fortunate indeed to have had this opportunity. Simply put...the 5000 SWA eyepieces are terrific!.,0
"This is really too bad. While the eye-relief is tighter on the 16mm and 20mm, these baby's are wonderful in slow to medium 'scopes. Not unlike a poor-man's XW or Panoptic at all. Great transmission, baffling, and resolution, right?.  Do you think Meade lost money on clearing these out? I doubt it was below cost. If these had been priced a little lower from the start well....  I'll echo the above, this was a fine line and it's too bad this option is going away..  And kudos to Astronomics for telling us what's going on..",0
"You can be sure somebody lost some serious $$$ on the final blow-out sale and it wasn't the dealers.  Either Meade or their Chinese manufacturer or both lost money.  The margins aren't like in the clothing industry.  Meade always finds a way to survive and puts out some surprizingly good stuff along the way.. I still have a truly amazing (modded for astronomy) ETX-125TB telescope/mount they made for a failed laser communications deal.  It's an unbelieveably high quality set-up.  Meade made money on that deal, Terabeam lost money and I scooped-up the scope nobody wanted.. There's still a few of SWA eyepieces out there at the sale prices if you google it.  They might take a few more weeks to fully run out of stock in every size.  Seems the 40mm is the easiest to find in stock..",0
"I'm glad I got the 28 when I did, it's a sweet spot for lower power but seems to be one of the best in the line from the reviews. I certainly like it in the limited use.. On a weird note...telescopes.com has odd prices on the 2 they have left. The 20mm went up a couple dollars to $68.98 (normally $64.50) and their 40mm went DOWN a couple dollars to $117.98. So right now telescopes.com has the cheapest 40mm with free shipping, plus you might be able to use some ocupons on it. I already own the 40, it's big but it's so comfy to view through.. If I didn't already own a 20mm pentax i'd have bought a couple more of these guys...it seems the 16/24/34 sets are still available...of course that's $200 more than just buying the 3 eyepieces separately. Will be interesting to see who breaks those sets up....",0
"Interesting UPDATE:. I just placed a call to Meade and was told there are more series 5000 SWA being shipped soon to OpticsPlanet!. I was going to cancel my back-order with them, but decided to leave it in place as I also got free shipping and a 5% discount coupon applied.  $736.25 total for two each of the 16, 20, 24, 28 and 34mm (binoscope use and more).. I asked the rep to confirm this a second time to be sure I didn't misunderstand and he told me there are definitely more SWA to be shipped to dealers very soon.. Thought some of you would want to know as many sites are still showing sale prices, including OpticsPlanet..",0
Charles you will have to post a pic when you get all 5 pairs in your possession..,0
"Telescopes.com always drops prices when they want to get rid of something. They aim to sell quantity and as soon as they make enough money they have no problem to put the last few items on sale. They are the Wal-Mart of telescope equipment.. That's how I was able to buy their last TeleVue BinoVue for $460 down from the regular $1050 price tag. I would never pay $1050 for that thing. I stacked coupons, special offers, etc on top of each other and dropped the price as low as it could get. Tonight I bought their last 40mm SWA for $106 with free shipping. Do I need one? Most likely not but who can ignore those low prices? My C8 will be tail-heavy soon.. They show the 40mm with a delivery day one week from now and the last two 24mm I bought yesterday with a delivery date of May 27th. Until yesterday the 24mm were listed as ""back-ordered"" but today they changed status to ""in fulfillment""; I guess that means they await a new shipment or something.. Regards.. DrF.",0
"Yup, Telescopes.com also has a $25. off $250. order coupon right now.  I just used it to get a pair of 8.8mm UWA for $254. shipped -Nice!. If the 40mm is too heavy/bulky, just remove the outer shroud for a lighter, slimmer eyepiece.  I've never used one, but the reviews are all good-good..",0
"I have been checking on the 8.8mm UWA for some time now. Even at $127 I cannot convince myself to spend the money. I bought the 16mm (x2), the 24mm (x2), the 28mm and the 40mm during the recent sale; adding the 8.8mm (x2) would be a lot of money. Adorama had a special sale on the 8.8mm until a month ago for about $120 per EP but I did not go for it.. In any case the 40mm is shown as ""shipped"" today, while the two 24mm went on ""backorder"" again. We shall see how this works out. Now we only need clear skies to play with our new toys.....

"I have ordered from telescopes.com before, and usually been pretty happy with their service.  This time I am really impressed. I ordered one of the last 40mm SWA eyepieces monday morning, it is being delivered today, total price with a $10 off coupon was $107..  I didn't need it, but it was hard to pass up...  Ken.",0
"Sounds like good deals all around.  I must admit that I do plan on taking a closer look at what Astronomics can do on pricing next time with a phone call even if their site doesn't show best sale pricing.  I completely forgot about the Astronomics Cloudy Nights discount plan, as well.  Apparently, each order from a CN member gets a discount..",0
"Since 12/2008 and until now I placed 21 orders with telescopes.com and most went through without problems. In one case they messed up some coupon deal and when I called to complain they allowed me to keep one item (worth $35) free of charge. The coupon at the time was $10 off.. My constant complain (which goes for Adorama as well) is that they don't pack well. They put the stuff in a box and send it out without adequate protective material. Free shipping has a price after all. The top vendor in terms of shipping is Astronomics. I placed an order only once but I was impressed by the way they packaged the small diagonal I purchased.. I am glad to see however that I am not the only one buying stuff that I do not need but I cannot let it pass up. That 40mm won't be of much use on a C8 but when the time comes to upgrade to a 16-inch scope it will work wonders. In the mean time folks, we need to do our part and help the economy of this country move forward. So, take those credit cards out and let's clean up the few eyepieces left from that wonderful sale.. Best.. DrF.",0
"I picked up the all the SWA's from hands on optics for the 50% off, but they were out of stock on the 16mm (found out after my order arrived). When i called they said they would not be getting any more in.. Anybody know who still has a 16mm? perhaps still on sale?. the 40mm is HUGE I'm really looking forward to using these..",0
"Not many places still showing sale prices and I don't see any with the 16mm SWA.  I have a pair of these on order with OpticsPlanet, but I won't be surprised if that part of my order gets canceled.  Everyone seems to agree that the backorders of 24, 34 and 40mm eyepieces will be filled -- not so sure about the 16, 20 and 28mm.  OpticsPlanet is already holding one 20mm for me and waiting for the backorder stuff to get in before they ship all together.. Sorry can't be of much help on the 16mm SWA.  I'll be darn lucky to get mine..",0
I have to agree on the 16mm. Only OpticsPlanet seems to have them and they are selling them for the full price. I was lucky enough to get two for my bino during the big sale and I like them a lot. Saturn was crystal clear through them. Currently telescopes.com shows the 24mm on backorder and they have one 20mm left in stock. AgenaAstro also seems to have all but the 16mm available and they still have sale prices.. DrF.,0
"I think the OpticsPlanet offering may be a lark.  They are out of stock on all the SWA right now and if the rumor is true that the 16, 20 and 28 are gone forever, they will have to cancel any orders they take on these.  We should know more in about a week or so.  OpticsPlanet said they would have more stock arriving about the 14th of May - next week.. DrF - Can you actually see the whole field of view in the 16mm?  Another user got rid of his because he said the eye relief didn't allow him to see the whole field, even without his glasses..",0
"The 16mm is probably a bit hard to see the entire FOV, the 20mm I bought for my club required the eye guard all the way down and my eye very close to the lens to see the entire FOV. I don't wear glasses. Specs say the 20mm has 15mm of eye relief, the 16mm only has 12mm of eye relief. The 24 however at 18mm was very easy to see the entire FOV..",0
"Telescopes.com has canceled my order of two SWA 24mm EPs. They claim that Meade has discontinued the series. So, as others have said before, that was all. No more SWAs and that's a shame because they are good EPs.. Regards.. DrF.",0
"If the 8.8UWA is anything like the 6.7UWA I have its a great WF ep even if its $150, I compared the 6.7UWA to the 7T6 and the ES6.7, the meade was neck and neck with the nagler so I'd upt to look at the 8.8UWA. I just received a new C9.25 yesterday and tried the 28SWA out last night on M13,M92,M57 and M27 latter that night, I was real surprised how flat the fov was maybe the last 5% wasnt exactly perfect but nice contrast and detail and a joy to use cause it had the nice comfort level to it..",0
I'm curious if anyone is using the Meade teleXtender with the SWA 34mm...someone mentioned they were going that route instead of ordering the 16mm...the ER on the 34mm would theoretically offer the same power BUT with far greater comfort. I own both BUT have not had the chance to try it out. I've used everything else and am truly impressed (including the 24mm which has performed beautifully in my C9.25...thanks skyjim)..,0
I use the 28mm SWA with the Meade TeleXtender and it works great. I used it last Tuesday with excellent seeing conditions and the view was totally transparent. No aberrations or vignetting of any kind and no change in eye relief. I even use the TeleXtender with the big 40mm SWA and also works perfectly. Despite the weight the scope handles it just fine.. Meade's own online store had the 16mm in stock at full price for a while but it has been removed today..,0
"Yes Jeff, I also have the 24&20SWA's they all work great but the fov with the 28 was soo sweet used on the F1o scope, it just grabs you when you look threw it. I use the 20SWA allot on my AT111, it works out real nice for panning the skies.. Jim.",0
"Latest Update on Super Wide Angle availability and back orders:.  OpticsPlanet just phoned Meade for me and then confirmed with me over the phone that the Meade 16 and 20mm SWA are gone FOREVER and orders for those cannot be fulfilled and all such backorders for the 16 and 20mm SWA must be canceled.   However, orders for anything other SWA, such as the 24, 28, 34 and 40 still have new shipments that will go out from Meade to dealers -- at least for now.   The good news surprise in this is that the 28mm still has some stock left to be shipped from Meade before it, too, is gone. This was unexpected based on previous information.  So, any of us who have a 28mm on backorder will likely get it.   I got the last in-stock 20mm coming to me from OpticsPlanet AND the last in-stock 20mm SWA from Telescopes.com coming to me, as well.  So, guess I'll be good on bino-use for all but the 16mm which have pretty iffy eye relief anyway..  I'll have doubles on the 20, 24, 28 and 34mm SWA -- glad I got in on this sale!  Telescopes.com has a $10. off $75. coupon with free shipping, so I added a nice $7.99 Zhumell lenspen and got the last 20swa for $66.97 with the cleaning pen for free and free shipping! Not bad, huh?.",0
"My two 20mm SWA's arrived today, hope to try them tonight.",0
hhmmm - just when I had decided I didn't like the twist eyecups here you are with a pic of them in your Denk which looks so nice! Please do tell all after your first light....,0
"Jim,. Any word on how your 20mm SWA bino-session went?.",0
"Jim, the 20mm SWA is one of the most used ep with my new C9.25, excellent contrast and detail, I would say they would be excellent with a bino. I also have the 24&28swa'a as well, I sold my beloved 22Pan and bought almost these 3 ep's, well a little cash added on my part but you cannot beat these ep's. I dont miss the 22Pan all that much the 24SWA takes its place and the 28SWA is one of the better 2"" 28mm SW's but the price is unreal, I am thinking about getting the 34SWA, I have the AT TitanII 35mm, ist light an easy to use but I use the 28 Meade more, its got that comfort level like the 22Pan had. Its a shame there being discontinued.",0
"Charles, I was just too tired to setup last night.  My Denkmeier Lunt 60 binoviewer adapter came today and I'll try the 20 SWA's for solar this weekend...weather permitting.. Jim, good to hear. Had to get in on the action before those 20's disappeared. I'am happy with the 40mm and still might take the 28mm.",0
"There's a 34 on AM used for around $75,mmmmmmm maybe I'll add it to the pack....",0
Thanks Jim -- I'm betting you end up having quite the fine time with all that new kit.  I'll be looking forward to when you get a chance to dash off a few lines post exposure.,0
"Jim and all -- I am very surprised to say that while I just received notification a few hours ago from Telescopes.com that one of my Meade SWA 20mm was shipped today, that it seems I am only one day shipping away from their Omaha headquarters and my 20mm is actually scheduled for delivery later today - Saturday! via Fedex ground. I live in a small town 20 minutes from Topeka, KS. I'm pleased I'll have at least one of my new Meade eyepieces to try out tomorrow night -- the first new EP in a long time. Sure hope I like it!",0
"Jim,  My 20mm SWA shipped yesterday afternoon and was delivered this morning at 10am! Telescopes.com did good by me -- the eyepiece looks great, very impressive and the AFOV looks darn wide for 68 degree spec'd.  I can't imagine wanting a wider view than this.  Anyway, hope to have observing notes to compare with you later today or tomorrow.",0
"Hi George,  Did some solar binoviewing with the 20 SWA's. The view was nice, but the wide rubber barrel made it a little uncomfortable for my wide-ish nose bridge to squeeze in between. Much better to view through in mono mode. Eyerelief was a little tight and had the adjustable eyeguard set to it's lowest position. All in all, they're nice buys for the going price, but not ergonomically(for me) the best for binoviewing..  Glad you are enjoying yours..",0
"Hi Jim,. Perhaps you will want to remove the shroud like many others have done to gain ergonomic satisfaction in binoviewing.  See   I am going to test this evening with the 20mm SWA, but I have another on order as well as sets of the 24, 28 and 34SWA and 8.8UWA for binoscoping.  I'm guessing all of them will be shed of their outer layers.  The process is also reversible.  Might want to try it, especially as the eyepieces were cheap on sale.  Be aware that if you use glasses, it's a good idea to put a little felt on the ends to avoid scratches to eyeglasses if you mod the eyepieces.. p.s. When you remove the shroud, you also gain about 2mm in eye relief.  I don't use glasses, so it's not a problem here, but a little more is better with these..",0
"George,  I don't wear glasses(not yet). I don't think I'll keep the two 20mm SWA's for binoviewing since I already have a pair of TV 20mm plossls which are more comfortable and a tad sharper.  I don't think I'll slim down the 40mm SWA since I like to rest my eye socket on the huge rubber eyecup, but will consider that option with the 20's if I keep them.",0
"""Oh my god, that thing is huge""... That's a phrase you normally hear during the screening of a porn movie. Lately it's a phrase that amateur astronomers use a lot. When they have the first look at the 40mm SWA that is. Mine came in yesterday and that thing IS huge. But not as heavy as I had thought it would be by reading the other posts here. It has only a tiny trace of grease at the bottom of the moving barel.. Of course as it has always been the case we have clouds in Southern California. But I am OK with this. The price was right, the service was fast and the item is new. My only complaint is not the packaging (it was adequate this time) but rather the 5%-off coupon they enclosed. It used to be 15%-off... Telescopes.com is out of stock on everything; they even sold the last two kits with the three SWAs in a case.. I have found a vendor that sells the 24mm SWAs for about $76 a piece but I already have the 16mm on the bino. The next size I use is the 32mm Omni from Celestron and I am happy with them. Should I go for the 24mm or not?. Best wishes for clear skies here and elsewhere.. DrF.",0
it sure is!,0
and a big chair is needed for THIS view,0
"Oh, I don't know.  However, never knew Celestron made a C-3!  Learn something new every day",0
"Not to mention all the exercise we get from moving the stuff around... I see the 2"" Meade 2x Ultra TX TeleXtender in that picture and I want one. Any sale on Meade Barlows coming up? Anyone? Regards.. DrF.",0
I guess size does matter.  Tim.,0
"As an interesting note, I took out the 'velvet' cushion from the box on the 16mm SWA I bought, to see that it is a recycled ""GHD"" package.. with the same white swirly designs and dotted GHD lettering on a black background.. See here for an example of the actual package pre-recycle:",0
"Out of curiosity I took out the cushions too and I checked their rear sides. On the 16mm I saw two whites, one gray and one red. I like the red one. On the 28mm both were black and this was the case on the 40mm. It could mean different cushion suppliers or who knows what else. By the way, telescopes.com has the 20mm and 40mm back in stock now but only a few pieces. They are either returns or new stock.. DrF.",0
"Make that one less 40mm in stock at Telescopes.com -- couldn't resist at $107.98 after $10. coupon (use QO-4279 for $10. off $75. purchase), free shipping and no tax!  I'm certain that most of these (probably all) are brand new stock as I called Meade twice to confirm that they had new 24mm, 28mm, 34mm and 40mm still to ship before they run out forever on these great SWA eyepieces.. What will I do with my 40mm Series 5000 SWA?  Well, I'm a binoscope user, mostly.  So, I may stick it in my finderscope - lol, it's too large for binoscope use -- what one can do with affordable gear!",0
For anyone else placing an order there try code VZ-3292. It's 10% off and would knock $10.79 off the 40mm!,0
"Bummer! I could have saved another 79 cents -- lol      Getting drunk on Meade -- what a way to go!. p.s. At least I saved another (previously undisclosed) $1.08 by using my PayPal debit card which returns 1% for every dollar spent) -- proprietary information, you know. So, my total was just $106.92",0
It still could've been 106.13! I'd ordered the 40 a few weeks ago when it was $125...then again it would've been twice that cost to get a good eyepiece like this normally..,0
"and you call yourselves astronomers.  No wonder you aim at the Moon and you hit Jupiter.... Let's do the math here: $117.98 - $11.8 (the 10% coupon) -$ 1.06 (my 1% Chase reward) = $105.12 only. So, just $105.12 out of pocket for that monster 40mm. I have it on my desk and keep looking at it.  Clear skies to all proud 40mm owners, no matter what your cost was. The sky in southern California was so bright from light pollution last night it was disgusting. I hope it will be better later on this week to try all the new SWA toys.. DrF.",0
"I received my 24 mm about a week ago.  But tonight was the first time I was able to bring my scope out, and one of the first things I did was to pop it in my 8"" GEM Newt.  It seems to have a similar weight to my hand as does the Stratus 21 mm, which is physically a bigger unit.  The seeing was distinctly awful up until around 9:30 or 10 PM.  After that it was just plainly awful.. I took a look at Venus; eh... a bright white dot, no phase visible, so it must be full.. But then I went to the moon!  Oh what a view!!  The 24 mm was as sharp as the 25 mm Sirius Plössl, but that 68° FOV!!!  I was able to contain the WHOLE circumference of the moon, with the lit crescent and the grayed out shadow rest of it (Earthshine, I guess).  What an incredible view!  There would have been no way to get that image in the Plössl.  The dark part was bluish gray and the crescent was on the barely perceptible yellow side of white.. I also peeked at Mars and Saturn with this Meade 24 mm SWA EP.  Mars was reddish-golden little dot (I was able to finally get some slight detail [a split-second every too many minutes] later at 562x barlowing my 4 mm TMB Planetary) but a sharp little dot.  Saturn was a pretty sight against a field of stars in that widefield view, a golden dot with a line through it... the ring shadow was visible for me even thought the 24 mm gives me only 42x, as well as Rhea and Titan, both appearing as ultrafine pinpoints, but they appeared!. Images were sharp and undistorted in my f/4.9 scope to about 5° from the edge, if the field is 68°.  Not bad.. Nice eyepiece this 24 mm.. The 16 mm is similarly a very nice eyepiece, with similar field quality characteristics.  But as everyone says, the eye relief is a bit shorter with the 16 mm, and you do have to crowd your eye onto the eye lens to see the whole field, but it's not like and still better than with a Plössl..",0
"At last, my 24mm and 34mm SWAs arrived, taking a long route via a relative in the States.. The 24mm has enough eye relief for almost-comfortable viewing with eyeglasses, and a quick look through the ETX-70 at distant buildngs shows a nice image. I'll see over the next week or so how it performs under the sky.. The 34mm appears HUGE to me - I've never held a 2"" eyepiece before, and I'm imagining te balance issues that both this 34mm and the the 24mm + 2x TV barlow will cause me on the lightweight 8"" briefcase dob.... The eyerelief on the 34mm is *comfortable* with my eyeglasses, and I can see the field stop without touching the glasses on the eyepiece.. All I need now is to complete the 8"" scope and then to wait for dark skies once again in late July. 52 degrees north means no true darkness at this time of the year..",0
"A while back I had asked a few questions on what eyepiece would make a good finder in my z10. I have a 24 pan that I use for this now, but I wanted something with more true field to aid in starhopping. Being that the swa meades are on sale for a great price I decided to try a couple out. If they workout well I will keep them and if not I am sure I can sell them as nearly new for a good price. Anyway I ordered the 34mm from astronomics which I received today in great shape. I ordered it on Sunday and they shipped it Monday. Fast shipping and great price 95.00 and change. I also ordered the 28mm, not from Astronomics but from OPT.  Unfortunately they were out at Astronomics. I have not received the 28mm yet though.  Back to the 34mm, This is a big eyepiece. I have a 17mm nagler t4 and it looks small by comparison. They are about the same weight it seems though which is not too bad. The build quality looks excellent on the 34mm swa. I did notice that both the top and bottom caps easily fall off if you are not careful. So I will have to take extra care when using this eyepiece.. I am hoping to have a first light with the 34mm tonight if it clears up some. I am very curious about the 34mm aswell as the 28mm(when it arrives.) I am worried about it coming to focus and if I will see the secondary shadow or not. Also how well these eyepieces are corrected compared to my Naglers.. Does anyone know if I will have a problem with the 34mm coming to focus in a F5 Z10 with the standard dual speed gso focuser? If it will not come to focus what extension piece do you recommend for a gso focuser? I ask this because it is getting cloudy and it looks like I might not get to use it tonight..",0
"I have both the 28 and the 34 SWA's. I've checked them out in three Newtonians: 6"" F8, 8"" F6 and 8"" F4 (yes I know the exit pupil with the 34 in an F4 is too large). The gave very good views in all three and I had no problems bringing them to focus. You shouldn't have any problems.. John.",0
Thanks John. Thats good to know..,0
"John a quick rule of thumb to see if the eyepiece should work is multiply your maximum pupil dilation times the focal ratio of your scope. If your under 30 or under then it should be 7, between 30 and 40 its drops to 6mm(pupil dilation) x5 which is 35. The 35 should be the maximum focal length you can use without the light cone being too large. This is just a general rule of thumb. I have both the 34mm and 28mm, am 50 yrs old and they work well in all my scopes even my F4.9. Bob.",0
Thanks Bob. John.,0

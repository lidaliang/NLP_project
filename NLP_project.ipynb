       " ['hello dennis,. i feel as if your posts are constantly biased against the mark v, but having owned a bunch of different binoviewers, i think it is the best binoviewer on the market. but lets address two of your \"problems\" with the mark v. first you say: \"and if you attach eyepeice tight in holder, you cant go up or down with it. so, clicklock system is not real holder with adjustable eyepeice position.\". you make this sound like a fatal flaw in the mark v and i would consider it a major benefit of the design.  with the mark v, once you set the diopter height, there is no need to change it when you change eyepieces. i would suggest that people think of this as more like a parfocalizing ring attached to the binoviewer. once it is set, you can change eyepieces and they will set at the correct heights for each eyepiece so that no focusing is necessary. i have changed eyepieces in my mark v many dozens of times and i have not had to change the diopter setting because it is not required. next, you write: \"also, clicklock is not self centring, neather helicall adapter is not. if you ask me, helicall adapter i would prefeer better, becasue it is lighter, takes smaller light path, and it is real focussable, and much cheaper.\". in fact, the mark v uses twopositioning ridges in each eyepeice holder that press the eyepeices up and out when the cam lock is activated. this ensures that the eyepeices come to rest in a position where the eyepieces are aligned to the optical axis and even at 8mm setting of my zooms, i have never ever ever seen any sign in miscollimation. i can change eyepieces in the baader and they always come to rest in perfect collimation. and this. the baader design more than most other designs i have used (though the bino vue and binotron would be its equal here) is excellent for zoom eyepeice use. with helical focusers, you have to hold the diopter with one hand while you zoom the eyepiece with the other hand. with the mark v or bino vue and binotron, you can zoom both eyepieces at the same time without fear that the diopters will turn.  the helical focusers are by comparion, for more tedious to use with zoom eyepieces. now for you that may not be an issue, but i did all my planetary observing with zooms and i found the rotating diopters to be the worst for this. you can lock them down, but now you have to slip focus the eyepieces every time you change them. finally, the mark v makes the task of changing eyepieces about as easy as it can be made. i have never used a binoviewer that allowed eyepiece changes as fast and easy as the mark v does.  i think your information is misleading.  you slam the mark v eyepiece holders, but most mark v owners (not all) will say that it is one of the most important benefits of the mark v.  i know i do. to recap:. you have expressed your opinion, but mine is simply that the mark v is one of the finest binoviewers ever sold. if one is going to buy a binoviewer without a power switch where a lot of eyepeice changes will be required, the mark v is a magnificent choice, and the cam locking eyepeice holders are a hugely important benefit of the product. just my opinion of course, and yours is yours, but i think yours is very misleading to those that might be considering buying a mark v and the statement that they do not self center is hugely problematic because the design results in a perfectly collimated view every time the eyepeices are changed.',\n",

(one of bill\\'s honorable mentions.) the largest tfov in a 1.25\" format. sharp across the field, good contrast, good color rendition, sharp field stop.  why wouldn\\'t you want this eyepiece?  - at titan ii ed.  the largest tfov in a 2\" format.  the 8mm exit pupil is pushing it in my 10\" dob.  but the image is similar in its goodness to that of the ultrascopic 35, only with a larger, 68 degree afov.  to recap, here is my top 10 list of eyepieces, in order of focal length:.  - xo 2.58mm. - xo 5.1mm. - brandon 6mm. - brandon 8mm. - lvw 8mm. - xw 10mm. - sterling plossl 25.1. - rke 28.7mm. - ultrascopic 35mm. - at titan-ii ed 40mm.  the es 82 30mm is an honorable mention, a runner up with the sterling plossl 25.1 to one of the slots in my top 10 list.  another honorable mention is the baader hyperion zoom.  now how could i forget to mention that eyepiece?  it\\'s in my focuser at least 80% of the time when i\\'m at my dark site.  the baader zoom is also my favorite grab-n-go eyepiece here at home.  but although its image is comparatively sharp, its forte is convenience and versatility, not high performance or even a niche ability.  jack-of-all-trades seldom make a top 10 list.  so i\\'ll leave the baader zoom off my list for now.  sorry, old friend!   mike.',\n",

my vote is that when the afov exceeds about 50-60 degrees, it is more about the \"wow\" perception experience and much less on the afov that can be \"critically observed\" or concentrated on\". i do indeed like the picture window \"pretty\" views but the afov that is actually used for critical observations is much less than what can be provided by these incredible (both in afov and expense) eyepieces. third, are we talking about the more or less common amateur (not semi-professional) astronomer in the middle class or are we to include those born with a trust fund or with incomes that permit literally unlimited descretionary funds? we should set a budget for the set and stick to it! the list should include eyepieces that are affordable to middle class amateurs or this list becomes an absurd wonder.! perhaps a limit on the sum of the current market price for the set of eyepieces should be set so we don\\'t end up with a list of eyepieces that would cost more than most amateurs could afford in a lifetime or for which no market price exists because there is no available supply! having no \"cap\" on the total price of the set of eyepieces will tend to create a list that is likely well beyond the budget of most amateurs. again, setting no upper limit is like suggesting that we list the top 10 automobiles of all time. most of us might not be able to afford even one of them and most of them would be unavailable at any price due to the rarity or lack of supply! perhaps we should have a list with a cap in the. fourth, some of the eyepieces on the list really have no market price because the number that appear for sale in any given year is extremely low or non-existent so assigning a market price is ludicrous because there is no supply. some eyepieces that are out of production or were produced in such small quantities that the number that become available for purchase in any given year may be zero. how do you establish the \"market price\" when there is no supply. obviously, some of these eyepieces are exceptional and deserve to be mentioned but if this is to be a \"working list\" that newer amateurs might aspire to achieve, then including more than one or two of these on any list is mere wishful thinking. several more modest eyepieces come to mind: the celestron 30mm silver top (taiwan, r.o.c.), the televue original 11mm nagler smoothside, the meade 56mm super plossl pseudo masuyama smoothside. fifth, we should have a list for the targets that are to be observed. the set of eyepieces which would be best for observing diffuse deep sky objects is frequently different than the set of eyepieces that would be best for planetary, lunar or solar observing and this would be best characterized by the differences in eyepiece afov and eyepiece focal length. sixth, we should take stock of the most common seeing conditions and most common transparency which we most encounter when we observe. i have a few local focal length eyepieces that are exquisite for observing the moon, jupiter, saturn or mars at high power when the seeing is spectacular but this means that those eyepieces languish in my eyepiece case most of the time and are used very rarely but when the conditions are right, those one or two eyepieces would be at the top of the list. likewise, i have a couple low power eyepieces that provide stunning views of deep sky objects when transparency is spectacular but this means that those eyepieces often languish in my eyepiece case most of the time and again, when the conditions are right, those eyepieces would be at the top of the list. i would be remiss if my set of eyepieces did not contain those \"once in awhile\" eyepieces but could they make the top 10 -- i doubt it -- but when the sky is right, those may be at the top of the list of my top ten list. finally, we should also consider the degree of light pollution encountered when using the eyepiece during our observing session. al nagler makes a strong case in his white paper \"the majesty factor\" which basically says that as light pollution increases, the highest magnification and largest real field of view combine to provide the highest contrast. basically, given equal real field of view, the eyepiece that has the highest magnifcation will result in the best contrast. if light pollution is absent (and moderate to severe light pollution is a huge problem for most of us middle class amateurs tied to lucrative jobs in larger metropolitan areas) then the case made in \"the majesty factor\" becomes irrelevant. i have 5 ota\\'s that range from f3.64 to f16. it would be absolutely ludicrous to list a set of 10 eyepieces that would provide optimum results for all observing targets under all observing conditions. there is an old adage, \"if every tool in your tool box is a hammer, then every problem you have encounter begins to look like a nail\". one of my ota\\'s is a vintage celestron comet catcher, another is a celestron carbon fiber c11 and a third is a celestron c5. i don\\'t think i could come up with 10 eyepieces that would do justice to all three! i use the comet catcher for rich field viewing (large and bright objects such as the andromeda galaxy or the triangulum galaxy or the north american nebula or the star clouds in the milky way) under dark skies as well as imaging. i use the c11 for observing deep sky objects (globulars, supernova remnants, nebula under dark skies and here at home for observing jupiter, saturn, mars and the moon as well as imaging. i use the c5 primarily for observing the sun with either a white light glass solar filter or an h alpha filter as well as, you guessed it, imaging. i also use the c5 as my traveling telescope when i visit distant places around the world. i use a meade 107d (4\"/f10 sct) as a finder/guide scope for the c11. when i travel, my lightest and most compact set of eyepieces is a set of original vintage celestron silver top plossls. if i was to pick a #1 eyepiece that would be appropriate to all my ota, i would probably include the original televue 11mm nagler smoothside. i also have a couple of refractors and some other odds and ends but i would not pick 10 eyepieces from my set that could meet all the criteria for any particular situation or instrument.',\n",

       " ['ok, in the spirit of this thread:. when i am traveling internationally (south of the equator mostly) i need a very light and compact setup. i need to be able to take most of my gear in my carry on because it would very likely be stolen from checked luggage. i typically take my black tube c5 (from the late \\'80\\'s or very early \\'90\\'s) starbright, xlt as my ota. my kit consists of a 2.00\" sct prism diagonal, a 2\" to 1.25\" adapter, a celestron deluxe 2x barlow (multi coated first edition silver top type), 30mm celestron silver top plossl (taiwan, r.o.c.), a 22mm celestron silver top plossl, a 17mm silver top plossl and a 19mm panoptic. with the 2x barlow, this is effectively 30mm, 22mm, 19mm, 17mm, 15mm, 11mm, 9.5mm and 8.5mm which is more than sufficient coverage for any observing i might wish to do and provides nice coverage of the \"sweet spot\" for this ota! sometimes i take my celestron nexstar 6se/8se with a tripod adapter for the nexstar mount, sometimes not. i normally determine well in advance if there is a walmart or target or something similar as a source for an inexpensive tripod once i reach the destination airport and then buy a heavy duty tripod for cheap because it will not returning with me. alternatively, i purchase a tripod and ship it to my destination in advance of my travel. they eyepieces can be packed in archival quality medallion coin tubes and can travel very, very compactly and very safely. if necessary, even in my pockets. the c5 ota (with or without the nexstar) goes in my on board carry on and i usually stash it under the seat in front of me so i can keep an eye on it. at the earliest opportunity, i acquire the tripod or claim it if i have sent it in advance. (there are lots of walmarts in chile and south africa!). i can even order a tripod that i like from walmart and have it delivered (free) for pickup at a local walmart (or affiliate) near where i am going even if that local walmart doesn carry the item. in australia, target or kmart are everywhere - same scenario as walmart in chile or south africa. how much easier can it be? most of the tripods are made in china anyway so they are all imported from the same source. my total setup is light, compact and can be carried on any commercial aircraft! when i travel south of the border, so to speak, i am targeting a destination site with minimal or significantly less light pollution (none comes to mind). i can\\'t even begin to tell you how satisfying the observing is!. for home and solar observing, i use the same c5 ota, the nexstar 6se/8se mount, an ancient celestron c8 wedge and tripod and i set the 6se/8se up in equatorial mode. i have a while light solar filter and a hydrogen alpha filter for the c5. because of limited seeing conditions due to solar heating, it is rare that conditions will permit less than an 11mm focal length for any eyepiece. my favorite eyepieces are a 19mm panoptic, 17mm silver top, 15mm silvertop, and 11mm nagler (smoothside). i have a 13mm nagler smoothside but it is a bit heavy for the mount! typically, i use only the 19mm panoptic and the 11mm nagler if conditions will permit. early a.m solar observing seems to be best. i actually have a full aperture solar filter and an off-axis solar filter for my c11 but i have yet to find sufficiently favorable seeing conditions that will permit better views than the c5!. so, i don\\'t even need 10 eyepieces. only about 5 for traveling and 4 for solar observing -- and all quite modestly priced. sometimes, instead of the 2\" prism diagonal, i use my vintage celestron multi ocular holder (moh) for convenience in switching focal lengths rapidly. the 11mm nagler is right in the \"sweet spot\" for this ota as regards magnification. for the 13mm, the \"kidney bean\" effect during daylight use (solar observing) is objectionable but the 11mm is ok. i don\\'t need or want +$5,000 of eyepieces to experience the wonders of the sky in abundance! the silver top plossls provide very crisp and high contrast views as do the original smoothside naglers. i have lots of other more expensive and wider field and more impressive sounding eyepieces but they are not particularly practical or desirable in the scenarios i have outlined.',\n",

       " [\"well, with all due respect i don't agree. there is a massive difference in pupil dilation between night and day. an eyepiece with significant spherical aberration of the exit pupil will therefore be unusable for solar. another factor to consider is the shape of the final lens and how that impacts ambient reflections. furthermore, in systems with rear etalons such as solar spectrum (baader) etc) the light cone is @ f/30 to minimise angle of incidence induced bandwidth smear. the merit function then is largely determined by matching the diameter of the eyepieces field stop to the diameter of the etalon, then pick an apparent field of view. that doesn't make the seeing overly offensive for that magnification, then you sift through those eyepieces left to find those with adequate eye relief and the smallest value of. exit pupil spherical aberration. another point to consider is that you really should be using a bino-viewer to look at the sun. it's a no-brainer. so the physical format of the eyepiece should be suitable for that. with the above in mind consider the following scenario. you spring the cash for a 25mm etalon (it gets seriously expensive as you go bigger). let's just arbitrarily say you have a 100mm refractor and similarly sized erf. the requirement of an f30 light cone means that you have to use a telecentric barlow to get the fl up to 3000mm. whoah!. forget short focal length eyepieces. so, 20mm gives you 150x magnification which is pushing a 100mm refractor pretty hard especially during the day. 65 degree field is as much as you can hope to use and not vignette the light from the etalon. your choice then reduces to basically a 20mm 65 degree eyepiece in a 1 !/4 inch format with long eye relief and zero spherical aberration of the exit pupil. in a mechanically compact format and good exclusion from stray light. forget ethos, naglers, nikon navs, es (all of them) and most of everything else. so no. your premium deep sky eyepieces are most definitely not a ticket to h-alpha nirvana. 2c. ~c.\",\n",

       "[['I posted this over in the EAA forum but it probably belongs here as well.... My AT60ED was delivered yesterday. I had a chance to use it last night. I purchased this scope to replace my 50mm repurposed guide scope. I can’t use a diagonal with that set up and my neck doesn’t like looking straight up for long periods like it used to.. The AT60ED is well constructed, a touch heavy (actually a tad heavier than my 4” F5 refractor) but very compact. I had to tighten up the focuser just a tad and that seems to keep the focuser from slipping with the 2-inch diagonal. The scope rides well on all my alt/az mounts including: the very light Bogen tripod with the light UA Dwarfstar head and is rock solid on the UA Macrostar. The AT60 can be mounted on the left or right side. The AT60ED and the NVD Micro with accessories all fit in my padded case.. The daytime views are all crisp, color free, and very nice. At 100x (the highest power I used) color was not seen during the day. Spider webs some distance off came into sharp view.. With a low, first quarter moon and in average seeing, the lunar views were crisp and color free at 120x. In better seeing, the scope should be able to take more power. However, the star test reveals somewhat obvious SA at maybe ¼ wave. This did not impact daytime performance and didn’t seem to hurt lunar viewing at the powers used and will have no impact on low power NV viewing. IMO The AT60ED is just too small for lunar/planetary viewing anyway. With just a couple of 90mm exceptions, with refractors, I like 100mm as a minimum for planetary viewing. But I didn’t buy the scope for lunar or planetary viewing.. Used with the NVD Micro and7, 2-inch reducer with a 6nm Ha filter and 685 pass filter, the field was sharp nearly to the edge with only the last 10% or so getting a touch softer – hardly noticeable unless you look for it. At 250mm FL (with the reducer) the field is about twice as large as with my 500mm FL F5 refractor. Using an Astro-Physics diagonal, and screwing the 2-inch7 reducer into the bottom of the 1.25 to 2-inch AP short adapter (which I like better than the Astrostuff 2-inch to C-mount adapter), my Micro comes to focus with about 3mm to spare.. Although I used the scope without a finder and without too much difficulty at that, I think a red dot finder will be added as soon as Astronomics gets finder shoes for this scope in stock.. With a first quarter moon out, a touch of moisture in the sky, and observing from my location in a gray zone just outside of Philadelphia, PA the complete North American Nebula including the Pelican fit comfortably in the field. The NA Nebula was bright, easy, with delineated edges and quite a sight. The complete Veil Nebula just fits in the field as well. The Veil was spotted easily with the brightest arc well seen and even the very dim “middle section” was not too difficult to spot. I knocked-off about 20 other nebula and all were picked up easily including a very low in the sky California Nebula that ran from the top to the bottom in the field of view.The big surprise was picking up a nebula that I had never seen before. While I was scanning the area around the Dumbbell Nebula, I spotted a dim but obvious, somewhat large, round glow nearby. After checking my atlas, this nebula turned out to be Sh2-90. So the first night out, and after observing the Dumbbell Nebula for 4 decades, I found a Nebula that I had never seen before! Of course this has more to do with the power of the Image Intensifier than the AT60 but it was still impressive to see under my bright sky conditions and with only a 60mm telescope.. The scope, tripod, mount head, and Micro can all be taken out as one unit and used without a chair for night vision, low power, grab-and go-viewing for those 20-minute ultra-wide filed views of the Horsehead, Flame, Orion, or the Rosetta Nebula on clear but freezing February nights or scanning Sagittarius on late summer nights before going to bed. With that use in mind this scope should do just fine.. Bob.',\n",

       " [\"Just an update on second light. I took the AT60ED back outside last night to see how it performed on my AT Voyager mount. For high power viewing on Saturn again, it was much preferred over the photo tripod setup. Vibrations were dampened much quicker, and the slow motion controls were invaluable. Even with the relatively narrow field of view of the Nagler 3-6 zoom, it was easy to track at max magnification. Despite physics, it actually felt like the little scope had more to give, but I'm unlikely to push it any higher than 120X. Unfortunately, the winds kicked up and seeing wasn't too great, but I was very encouraged with this combo. Also, I picked up an Amazon Basics camera backpack for about $20 from Amazon. The scope easily fits in the backpack with room for the diagonal and a few eyepieces. It is designed for a camera, so it isn't perfect, but I really like the portability so I can just throw it on my back, grab the mount and head out the door to find a spot to stargaze.\",\n",

I personally will stick with 24 Panoptics, 17 UWANs, and smaller Naglers for my bino viewing, especially considering the price point. I think they are 100 dollars rich to the price point.. I did ask Al about my personal desire, which is a very high polish Televue quality Ortho, and the response I got was that the Delite would be a better eyepiece. That still doesnt satisfy the desire for an ultra high quality Ortho for me.... Maybe Zeiss, or Nikon, will introduce some..\n",

It did not say \"don't tell anyone\", so I'm telling.<br/><br/>Don Yeier is issuing a limited run of 50th Anniversary Brandon sets (limited to 100 sets). Six Brandons (6,8,12,16,24,32mm), gold anodized, in the fancy presentation case (which I can tell you is *very* nice). This is the same set I have, except mine are black, and these don't seem to have eyecups (but I could be wrong about that). <br/><br/>The price is VERY good. If you're contemplating spending Ethos-type money on eyepieces, look into a set of Brandons instead. They won't be available forever, and I'd bet this set won't last long at all.<br/><br/>Brandons are the *only* all-American-made eyepieces (optics, housing, everything), and are among the very finest eyepieces you can get. Eventually Don will retire, and Brandons will either disappear or the brand name will get bought up and probably outsourced overseas. They're available now. I'd jump on this if I didn't already have a set. Since I got them, my whole box of Naglers almost never gets used. They're that good. <br/><br/>(I'm not affiliated with VS in any way except for being crazy about their products).\n",

Planets, for example.  Since observing occurs generally on-axis, and the target itself benefits greatly from maximum contrast, sharpness and resolution, I would think that the best eyepiece for the job is the one with the best image and not extraneous (to this class of target) field of view.<br/><br/>Double stars can be nice with a little field context, but like planets I would trade 15 degrees of extra AFOV and no split shown gladly for an eyepieces that can consistently render a tough split.<br/><br/>I guess there are folks that just love hammers no matter what the job, but I've generally found screwdrivers to be more effective than hammers for inserting screws.  <img alt=\":lol:\" class=\"bbc_emoticon\" src=\"https://www.cloudynights.com//public/style_emoticons/default/lol.gif\"/><br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Jim\n",

       " <!--cached-Thu, 05 Sep 2019 08:21:11 +0000-->Hi all,\n",
       " <br/> <br/>I can only say that even though I have 2 complete sets of Brandons as well as the incredible 48mm, 6mm, and a special 4mm, I will call Don and inquire about the 50th set. What a great commemoration -- Thanks for he heads-up Rick.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>Many of you know that I have been obviously evangelical about Brandons since I joined this wonderful community here on CN. I have always been a proponent of these terrific eps' for all the reasons so eloquently stated by so many of you above.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>For me -- it's always been that remarkable contrast and clarity and the sheer image depth -- that astonishing quality dimensionality, that set these eyepieces as a unique class apart from everything else I've ever used. \n",
       " <br/> <br/>I use Brandons in my Binoviewer and this configuration is extraordinarily far more than the simple sum of the two and I use them for virtually all my observing needs. Oh -- and the FOV -- the ~50 deg FOV is PLENTY. Observing M42 in the 32 mm with my 10\"LX200R is a \"fall-into-it\" experience and the subtle \"mottled cloud\" detail of this nebula and others so apparent in these ep's is hard or invisible in others. A really fine view with any ep is to pull out the Trap e and f stars on a good night. It's thrilling, but with a 16 mm Brandon barlowed at ~315X we have seen the Trap g star on a really good night as well.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>Deep sky: In a 17.5 inch f/4 Dob with the 8 mm Brandon we still had all of M51 and it's companion in the field completely -- the subtle bridge was a glowing knotty mist between the two.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>I could go on but I know I'm preaching to the choir so I will only say to those readers who have not had the opportunity to observe with these ep's -- try one. You will be amazed at the way you will SEE with this \"old fashioned\" eyepiece.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>Just my 2-cents.\n",
       " <br/> <br/>Clear skies,\n",

Well, ES claims that it comes with a 2.5\" Hexagonal focuser but the picture available on the company web page does seem to prove that. When we look at the focuser of the FL-AR1021000EQ3, it is clear that it comes with a regular rack-and-pinion and, in my humble opinion, it seems identical to the one from the FL-AR127. The description says something totally different from what my eyes can show me. Besides, there is no carry handle either. Unfortunately, I can't find any piece of information about the optical design. If the FL-AR127 is just a doublet, then, it is not equivalent to the Bresser Messier AR127. \n",

No specific information at all about the lens construction so we can infer that that the ES FL-AR1271200 is the old version of the Bresser telescope unless it really comes with the 2.5\" Hexagonal focuser..  .

Franky, I find difficult to discriminate between what's true and what's false if what seems to be the official description of these eyepieces states that:.  . people wearing glasses very often have the problem to see the entire field of view when they are using eyepieces with large apparent fields.

Getting a wider apparent field is a valid reason to switch, if that is your preference, but don't think you're going to avoid distortion by doing so.\n",

Yes, you can move the ghost away from the main image when looking at Jupiter, but I find it difficult to hold my eyes still in one position, so the reflection keeps on dancing around the field anyway as I move my eyes. I find that very distracting even if it's not on top of the planet image.. Some eyepieces show the reflection more than others. It really depends how bad it is in this eyepiece.. Between the (budget) eyepieces I tried out in the 60-70 degree range, the only one that has a tolerably small amount of eyeball reflection, for my taste, is the Hyperion. Which by the way has more lenses than than the other designs I tried.. \n",

In my f/7 refractor, it was sharp to about the 50° field point and the last 6° on each side with a fair amount of astigmatism.. The 31mm Hyperion deteriorated at about 10-11° from the edge of the field, making the center 50° fairly sharp.. So they are fairly equivalent but for the fact the Hyperion is 10° wider in apparent field (38mm field stop). The ES has noticeably more eye relief..  . Which one is appropriate will depend a lot on the focal length of the scope.. In my 714mm refractor, True fields are 2.7° and 3.0° respectively, which covers the same objects quite well.. But if the f/7 scope were an 8\". then true fields would be 1.35° and 1.53° respectively and you might want to go for the wider true field for larger objects.. \n",

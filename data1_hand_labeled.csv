11,if aperture rules why is it that refractors are so popular,"Collimation is so simple and it takes only a short while. Even if I am alone and have to climb up and down the ladder, my big scope only takes two or three minutes.. Took me about 15 minutes to tweak collimation on my Tinsley Cassegrain last night. But, I'm new to this - induced more error on the first try - and the scope hardware is 70+ years old. For high resolution viewing, it was worth it. Couldn't believe it's just a 6"" mirror. As I posted in Cats & Casses, if this scope had a wider FOV, it would seriously challenge my refractors on open clusters. Saw so many faint background stars in the field with Saturn that I couldn't ID the smaller moons. Never happened before with any of my scopes, and the seeing wasn't great..",1,4
12,if aperture rules why is it that refractors are so popular,"Are refractors more popular than scopes with mirrors.... Yes.. From 1960 to NOW, a much larger number of small refractors have been bought & used than any other telescope design. Shop the used scope market on eBay, browse the online or local Dept Stores, the evidence is there unless you refuse to see it. For every 1 used reflector on eBay, there are at least 10 used small refractors on any given day. Unless the achros are reproducing under the cover of darkness, more were made, bought, and used over the years.. In Darwinian terms: Survival of the fittest. Takes more abuse to wreck a small refractor -- though some folks do manage to do it!. It's not a tough call. It's a demonstrable fact.. And... it's all Jim's fault..",4,2

Specifically, the Encke Minima showed up more clearly, the C ring could be better seen across the face of the planet, and Cassini's Division was tack sharp all the way around. Colors were also more saturated, and not overexposed, thus allowing me to see polar detail not visible in the video.. Of course, it's not a fair comparison. I doubt the iPhone's camera lens has the resolution to sustain 1080p video, let alone 8 megapixels, or what the 28"" scope is actually able to show visually..",4,3
15,if aperture rules why is it that refractors are so popular,"Visual use looking at which objects? Certainly not for dim galaxies and nebulae. For those objects, the very good 12"" Newt would outperform the 5"" refractor by a very large margin. We are observers of objects after all, not just owners of telescopes.. I would also contend that the 12"" Newt - during moderately good seeing - should outperform the 5"" refractor when observing bright planets and the Moon as well. Actually I can't think of many objects that would be better visually in the 5"" refractor, except for perhaps the Milky Way and very large DSO. So beyond those objects, why would the 5"" refractor be better visually? Why? Because it's easier and more convenient to bring out for observing, and is quicker to acclimate? Yes, I'd agree. But would those advantages mean that the 5"" is better for visual use than a 12""? IMO, I think that's a stretch.. Mike.",1,4

17,if aperture rules why is it that refractors are so popular,"I submit that the reasons why you would consistently have such horrid performance from your Newtonians could potentially be:. 1. Damaged primary and/or secondary mirror. 2. No regard for / lack of knowledge on collimation. 3. No provision made for active cooling of the primary. 4. High expectations for detailed viewing with a large reflector when seeing is horrid. 5. All of the above. My 2c having toyed in the past few years with a couple of dozen refractors (my own - not just for quick looks) and a few reflectors:. 1. Refractors offer a more pleasing image overall and yield better results than equivalent / slightly larger aperture reflectors.. 2. If proper care is taken to bring a reflector to full potential (cooling / collimation / care for the optics), then a much larger reflector will demolish a refractor.. 3. The effects of seeing will affect the quality of image in a larger instrument more than a smaller instrument, but this relates to the size of aperture in relation to seeing and NOT to any inherent weaknesses in reflector design.. Don't take it wrong, I love my refractors and I figure in the end when I grow old, I would like to do so with a 4"" refractor, a nice Alt/Az mount and a selection of 4-5 eyepieces.. But as long as my back will permit me to drag my 12"" (the largest I can use due to bad back), I will do so as I want to nuke my observing eye with as many sharply focused and contrasty photons as a properly cooled high quality collimated optical system can offer..",1,4

Each time we produce a telescope or mount, we contact the people on these lists, offering them an opportunity to order. There is no obligation to purchase the instrument if you are on the list, and you do not have to pay a deposit. Signing up on the notification list did not constitute an order. It is merely a list that indicates your interest.. ""Effective with the launch of this website in late March 2019, we are no longer accepting names onto the original lists. HOWEVER, we will maintain the original lists and use them for future telescope and mount sales until each particular list is exhausted."" (Emphasis in original.).

I received a prototype for testing several years ago at the request of a dealer thinking of white labeling the OEM scope. The scope came with a test report claiming 0.95 Strehl. It was literally junk optically. No way, no how, did that report correspond to the optics in the scope it accompanied.. Conversely the best of the best - Takahashi, A-P, TEC, etc. - do NOT provide documentation with their optics. Yet independent tests of optics from these producers are consistently excellent.. In consumer goods pieces of paper proclaiming quality are more often than not marketing gimmicks, literally not worth the paper they're printed on. Expensive B2B goods are another matter. But the manufacturers of relatively inexpensive goods that resort to paper claims know well that most buyers have no means or will to verify the accuracy of the claims on the piece of paper. Low risk, high reward.. So unless you have a basis for trusting the paper report, you're no more informed than if you did not receive the piece of paper.

However, in Astronomics case, it is well known that they publish eye relief from the closest point you can put your glasses on, rather than from the top center of the eye lens.  If the true eye relief is 5.6mm, then Astronomics subtracts the the distance from the lens to the top of the folded down eyeguard.  I don't know what that distance is, but if it's 1mm less than the true eye relief, then the numbers are consistent.. I have, in the past, argued that Astronomics should quote both the true, optical eye relief and the ""usable"" eye relief for eyeglass wearers separately, and under separate labels, since wearing glasses isn't the only context in which eye relief matters to people, and in the some other contexts, usable eye relief for eyeglass wearers can be overly pessimistic.

The views of Mars tonight are simply stunning, I have never seen such surface detail.  I have never seen Mars look like in photos until tonight, the seeing is very very good here in Southern California.  I am seeing very crisp images all the way through the 8mm pair with 2.25X Denk OCS barlow (I have not gotten the 6mm pair yet so the 8mm is my shortest focal length).  There are no issues with merging or focus.  Images are sharp to about 80 percent going just a bit soft at the edge.  The 8mm's shorter eye relief is a bit tight but no problem - forget using glasses though below 16mm.  That 16mm pair really hits the sweet spot, very very comfortable.  The 32mm pair is almost too generous with eye relief.   There are no issues with glare or anything else really.  Contrast was superb, and the color was very ""white"" and pure.  I had no problem discerning color and surface features on Mars without the use of a filter.  I had a lot of fun switching back and forth between the different FLs.

On the CA side, I do remember that when viewing Jupiter, the color fringing on the edges was quite evident (and something I was not used to, coming from using a mak), while when observing the moon I didn't notice it as much, perhaps because at 312x there was less ""black space"" since the field of view was full of white moon.. Whatever the reason, my recollection is that observing the moon with that 4mm VITE was a nice experience, even with the C90 Mak..

119,vite 23m aspheric,"This is often a difficult thing to nail down, and all of us use a different benchmark I think when we say ""sharp"". For me, not talking resolution per say, but that the view is a little crisper and more defined. So boundaries are more distinctly defined and the overall impression of image contrast seems greater. So a host of factors, all in small measure, that simply make the image clearer or sharper perceptually. Comes across notably for me on lunar.. For me, it's not that I would consider these as a replacement to my other 20mm-class eyepieces because the build quality is well below the level I like...and especially because plastic components are used for interior threading and retaining rings so wont have good longevity if served more than a few times. But it is just ""tickles"" me at how clear and sharp they are and their off-axis performs typical for any three element design, perhaps better, with this wide of an AFOV. The *interesting* comparison IMO would be the 23 Vita vs the 25 Paradigm or 25 HD 60. Interesting from the perspective of how the off-axis compares in a given focal ratio between the non-aspheric more complex designs and this aspheric simpler 3 element design.

If there is a choice between a TV and pretty much any other brand, I will put my money on brand X. every chance, IF the non-TV eyepiece is equivalent.. My choice of eyepieces centres on their ability to be used in binocular telescopes for public outreach.. What makes an eyepiece attractive to me is: A slim barrel (mechanical ergonomics), well controlled SA of the exit pupil, long eye relief and well controlled field aberrations at fast F ratios.. Other than a collection of Morpheus and a couple of TAK LE's (for solar)... The rest of my keepers are TV. (credit where it's due). In that context, I think the A11 looks like a ground breaking design.. How an eyepiece with 19mm of (usable) eye relief, which is sharp to the field edge and bino-friendly with an 85* FOV can be considered to be not innovative. when it is the only eyepiece available that can do that is absolutely beyond my comprehension, as is the claim that TV isn't innovative?.

It is a self-assembled 10"" f/6 using a mirror I bought in 1992 from a guy in Orlando named McCoy who made optics for NASA. He had a comfortable business making perfect 8"" mirrors for the Japanese amateur market. I was looking for the best mirror I could buy and I stumbled onto this. I think his shop was called 'Perimetric"" or something like that. He advertised just once in S & T. Under perfect conditions it resolves to or past the theoretical limit. I used a heavy (3/16"") wound paper tube that I got at a place in Lorain OH that made bases for department store mannequins. It has a Novak cell and spider,  and about 12 years ago I upgraded the Novak focuser to JMI. It is a dob based on a design from Berry's book about 1988. In 2006 I bought a new car which I knew the telescope wouldn't fit in so I cut the tube in half and then worked for a year to figure out how to make it go back together. I used a metal-on-metal keyed joint with cabinet latches. It holds collimation in two pieces better than it ever did in one piece. Go figure that out. Best wishes- PJT.",4,2

181,delite eyepieces,"If you construct a triangle with the apex at the exit pupil and the base as the width of the eye lens,. then the apparent field (the angle at the apex of the triangle) is constrained by the width of the lens.. The apparent field could be narrower (not all the eye lens used), but it cannot be wider that the angle at the apex of the triangle.. One caveat: eye relief could be a little greater if the eye lens is deeply concave. The sagitta below the edge-to-edge dimension would be. added to the eye relief from the base of the triangle up to the exit pupil.. Taking the NAV-SW as an example:. the 10mm has a stated eye relief of 19mm and an apparent field of 72 degrees.. That means that if we grant the center of the lens has a depth of 1mm (looks likely in the photo), then the eye relief above the base of the triangle is 18mm.. That puts the lower limit on the eye lens width as 26.16mm.. The eye lens could be wider than that, but it cannot be narrower and yield a 72 degree apparent field or have 18mm of eye relief above the edge-to-edge straight line. unless the center of the lens had a concavity greater than 1mm.. Now the 10mm Delos (also 72 degrees) has an eye relief of 20mm stated, and an eye lens that is essentially flat.. That means the eye lens must be at least 29.1mm wide, and it is 35mm.. But remember the exit pupil is not a point--it has a width. If I interpret this correctly, it means that the eye lens must be wider than the absolutely minimum width in order to provide adequate illumination of a point at the periphery of the field--say, 70%. How much larger depends on the degree of illumination at the edge. Since the same focal length produces a larger exit pupil in shorter f/ratio scopes, unless the edge illumination is going to diminish in short f/ratio scopes, the lenses have to be wide enough to provide adequate edge illumination. Ergo, the eye lens must be larger than the absolute minimum in order to illuminate the edge of the exit pupil and it has to be even larger to yield the same edge illumination in faster f/ratios. Since the manufacturer doesn't know the f/ratio of the scope the eyepiece is to be used in, adding a few millimeters to the minimum value seems a safe course.. But, if you discover the eye lens is not as wide as the minimum value, either the eyepiece doesn't have the stated apparent field or, more likely, doesn't have the stated eye relief.. It may also have a serious amount of vignetting at the edge of the field, and some modern eyepieces, in fact, do roll off the light at the edge in order to use smaller lenses.. Such an eyepiece would also vignette more in shorter f/ratio scopes.. One other aspect of eyepiece design that might enter into the picture is the index of refraction of the glasses used. High index glass can have stronger bending occur in passage through the lens, and the same illumination occur with smaller lenses. These high index glasses (sometimes called ED or ELD) can increase the cost of the eyepiece and/or lower its availability if there is any interruption of the delivery of the raw materials necessary to make such glass. In essence, make the eyepiece for a longer f/ratio, or with a lower illumination at the edge, or with more exotic glass, and/or with less eye relief, and it can be smaller.. We have a lot of examples of that in the marketplace..",4,3

192,new baader mark iv 8 24mm zoom eyepiece,"If you don't mind, let's put this into context.. If one has a scope that doesn't take 2"" eyepieces then a 2"" finder eyepiece is not an option.. If your other eyepieces are Plossls, the ones that came with your scope, then the 24 mm 50 degree setting on the BHZ is similar to the 25 mm 50 degree Plossl that comes with many telescopes as the low power eyepiece. So, by comparison, the 24 mm BHZ setting can be your finder. However, for a 1.25"" focuser a 32 mm Plossl would be better.. But I agree, I would not buy the BHZ specifically as a finder eyepiece. That is not its design purpose. And, while I don't use the 24 mm FL of the BHZ as a ""finder eyepiece"" I often use it to reacquire a target that may have slipped out of the FOV at higher mag. So, in that context, I do find it useful as a finder eyepiece without having to change eyepieces.. As to edge correction. You say that some of your eyepieces are better. So that means that some are not as good. If I may ask, which of your eyepieces do you feel have better edge correction and what do they cost new so that we know what you are comparing this eyepiece to. Again, just setting context..

Second, the deeply recessed eyelense enhances this sense of a narrow FOV. Third, while I can’t prove it, the field often seem dimmer in the Baader plossl."" So, Dave's conclusion was the 35mm Ultrascopic is better. Of course, YMMV, but the fact this EP is the only one in this line is on sale at $62 for a long time says something.

""A reminder: A Galilean's FOV scales as the diameter of the objective. At given power, double the objective diameter and you double the FOV. Provided the eyepiece has sufficient diameter at given separation from the eye. To maximize FOV, get the eye as close as possible; unlike the positive eyepiece, there is no external exit pupil and hence no fixed eye point.. The seeming too-large 'exit pupil' here is a consequence of the large objective chosen to expand the FOV. The light bundle for any one image point occupies only a portion of the objective, this effective diameter equalling the magnification multiplied by the observer's iris diameter. For ever farther off-axis image points, the location on the objective for the relevant light bundle moves ever farther from center to edge. This is in the very same manner that most wide angle camera lenses operate."".

213,nikon wx testing,"I just got back after a round of testing the new Nikon 7X50 and 10X50 WX, conducted at the retail shop, Focus Scientific, here in Ottawa. My principal interest was the 10X50, for obvious reasons. There's a fair *chance* I'll go back again tomorrow, so if you have any specific points needing addressing, ask away.. In a word, WOW!. They meet my expectations, based on published info. That is, there were no surprises at all. Including the fact that the published figures for the AFoV understate reality notably, due to their being merely calculations.. Using the flashlight-through-the objective test, which projects a circle of light as defined by the field stop, I measure AFoVs of:. 7X50, 71 degrees. 10X50, 85 degrees. These figures should be correct to within about 0.5 degree.. It goes without saying that they utilize the full aperture on axis. But the circle of full illumination is quite small. But that's absolutely OK! A baffle, which appears to be within the prism system, is sized so as to provide maximal stray light suppression without impinging on the axial light cone. This is a very good strategy; it mirrors my own preference in my home-made binos.. False exit pupil segments, or 'fingernails' as we like to call them, are a NON ISSUE. There are two, but even the worst is such a tiny sliver as to be of practically no import... IF it were to be sufficiently near the principal exit pupil, that is. But nope, these pupil segments are well and safely removed from ever falling upon one's iris.. The region surrounding the exit pupil is agreeably dark when the instrument is pointed up toward the daytime sky. Which means that unless direct ingress of a quite bright light source illuminates the interior walls and prism/lens edges, this source of scatter to reduce contrast is vanishingly small. I should conduct some further testing under extreme conditions to explore this further, so as to divine just what surfaces would be illuminated and how near/far from the exit pupil they lie.. By *visual* comparison of an illuminated surface seen directly and through the the bino, I *crudely estimate* a transmission in the neighborhood of 90-ish percent. I could detect a slight dimming, which I feel must preclude a transmission of 95+%. But do note that such visual comparisons are fraught with the potential for illusion. If I can rig up an add-on tube for my SQM in time, I'll strive to obtain a much more reliable measurement, which I should think will have an error of no larger than about 1%.. More to follow...

218,nikon wx testing,"Longitudinal chromatic aberration is invisible. A good quality 4X10 bino placed behind the eyepiece, thus acting as a 4X quadrupler, shows a still mighty fine image! The resolving power far surpasses the eye's ability to resolve. At this 40X on the 10X bino, details on a moderately distant power pole and its hardware were revealed which I think could hold up reasonably well compared to a dedicated 40X50 spotting scope of middling quality.. There is lateral chromatic aberration, which I suspect is introduced by the eyepiece. At the field edge, where it's naturally of maximal magnitude, I estimated the angular width of the colored fringes on a distant power pole as seen against the brighter sky. When the pole is placed near the right side field edge, there is a purple fringe seen against the right side of the pole, and a green fringe seen adjacent to the left side of the pole, projected against the sky. These two fringes are of essentially equal width. The pole was measured to be some 400m distant, using a laser rangefinder. It's apparent angular width I estimate to be some 2 arcminutes. The colored fringes for the 10X bino were about 1/4 the pole width, or about 1/2 arcminute. At 10X this is a magnified apparent width of 5 arcminutes. I did a quicker examination of this for the 7X50, and find a roughly similar magnified apparent colored fringe width of some 5 arcminutes. And so the *apparent* extent of this fringing is about the same for both binos at each's field edge, in spite of the smaller AFoV for the 7X unit. Note that these are *estimates*, which certainly could be improved upon.. Field flatness is excellent. Even for my increasingly crystalizing eye lenses  , for which focus accommodation is poor, it required no refocusing whatsoever to retain best sharpness as I scanned across the full field.. No astigmatism of note was seen even to the field edge. But if I go back tomorrow we'll be using an artificial star as seen across the building's basement. In such darkness I'll be using the full aperture due to my dilated irises. I just hope the near focus accommdates this.... I had no trouble at all seeing both fields in their entirety. But then, I also do well with 100 degree AFoV oculars in bino mode.. Late afternoon car headlights did not reveal any roof line-induced diffraction spike. I plan to use a blazing LED flashlight in the darkened basement to make for a *much* more extreme test.. The daytime impressions, using high amd low contrast test subjects, were most positive indeed. Based on this, I feel confident that nighttime performance will not disappoint. But it sure would be nice to have had that opportunity!. Hopefully more to come tomorrow....",5,5

How about the apertures throughout the prism system? If the Miya, as viewed from the front, through the edge of the objective, shows less of the perimeter of a field stop of given diameter, that would be another contributing factor.. As I've stated before, better for contrast to have a smaller circle of full illumination if this reduces these light leaks.

With some practice, you can learn to relax your eyes and look  the binos into infinity while looking at a target of known angular diameter like Jupiter.  You can then estimate the number of planetary diameters the images are displaced by and come up with a number.. At 16x the standard for divergence (relative to the viewer) is 3 arc minutes but for many, myself included, a 1 arcminute error can become apparent at that mag.

This time next year my arms will look like Popeye's.. I do have a zero gravity chair and spent some time in it but overall I just preferred. to stand and sweep the sky. The Sagittarius area was amazing but so was sweeping. the outer arms when they rose later in the night.. Hard to say what my favorite targets were. The alpha Perseus association was. particularly nice as was the double cluster. The whole line from Auriga to Sagittarius. was entrancing. Stars and the major nebula show up very well and bright. I was. very pleased with the coatings and ergonomics. I did notice the double star effect. on the brightest stars that people have commented on in the LOA's. I probably only. saw them because I looked for them, otherwise I doubt if I would have noticed.. M33 was another surprise for me; it popped right out when sweeping by.. Just playing with the star fields was fun. Move a little to slide a star off the close. grid and suddenly it's in the background.

255,loa 3d binocular,"But RD is deliberately used in the eyepiece! So if one is really interested in doing ""science"" and needs an accurate view of what they are observing or studying, then then should be using an older Abbe design eyepiece and nothing modern. Heck, even the current day Abbes have been modified to the point that they show some RD since they are built to work on very fast f/4 systems. So just making point that if science is the goal, then wide field eyepieces should not be used as they introduce fakery.. In all honestly, I would posit that probably more than 90% of amateur astronomers do the hobby forentertainment andself gratification, not science. I think it has been like that for at least the past half century. Real science has so far past what can be done at the amateur level that the process that amateurs use for astronomy, which is mainly visual observing with small aperture optics, is a process that ""science"" left behind more than a century ago.So anything we are doing today was perhaps a good scientific process in the 1800's, but by today's standard it is not at all (there are a few exceptions of course like amateur contributions in variable and double star astronomy - but that is a small group that does that).. IMO the ""science"" in amateur astronomy is more in the reading and studying that many do to educate themselves on the various astronomical objects and phenomena. The equipment to look at it or take pictures of it is more like a field trip and not ""science"". FWIW, I have been observing now for almost 50 years, and I have to say that observing an object in the simulated 3D of the LOA21s really brings to forefront that a dimensional nature of the object exists. In traditional flat-viewing this aspect of the object is often forgotten and overlooked. So really, seeing it in a 3D view, even though it is artificial, triggers curiosity about the target that motivates one to see if we have hard science on the object that reveals its true 3D nature. So as example, when was the last time you looked at M13 and wondered exactly which of the more prominent stars in the Glob were in the foreground vs background? You cannot tell this by brightness because the brighter foreground star may well be just a more luminous star deeper in the cluster. So looking at M42 in the LOA21s last evening for the 1st time, it really began to spur my curiosity to begin to study and memorize the depth relationships of that nebula so when I observe it in the future, I can try to use that knowledge to imagine it in proper 3D space. I never was motivated to do that at all with traditional observing...but the new LOA21s have sparked that curiosity. So of course there is an entertainment component to the LOA21s and the 3D binoculars, but there is also that component to the traditional flat-view monoviewing, and since most folks observe with wide fields and not Abbe Orthos, really all the viewing we do is not showing us the reality of what is up there. Heck, I ditched the 82 degree EPs because I was fed up with how distorted lunar features were in the off-axis...I just do not want to look at such overt features and watch them change shape and orientation when the drift from edge to center...it's like viewing the Moon in a fun house mirror! From a scientifically correct view standpoint, I think the wide field eyepiece is the biggest offender because the marketing is silent to that reality, whereas at least on the new 3D technologies Denkmeier has been forthright saying it is simulating 3D and not real.

The APM's are really nice, and I can see why everybody likes those eyepieces. By the way the Orion 18mm UFF's and the APM's are identical.. I also have the Orion GV BT-100, which is basically thenewerAPM Semi-APO. Also an excellent Binocular by the way. Don't let the Orion name turn you off to it, because it arrived in perfect condition, and perfectly collimated, and throws up an excellent viewing experience for being an achro.. Does the APM APO use the same body as the Semi-APO?.Just ask because physically the Orion is a little bigger and fatter, while the Oberwerk is much more streamlined and lighter. Eyepieces defiantly fit the Orion better. Kevin made his eyepiece holders kind of tight. Maybe to tight?. Had to sale my TakFS-78 to help fund all of this. Hopefully someone has a chance soon to view through both the Oberwerk EDand APM APO, and can tell us what they think. That would be interesting for sure. I know I'mtapped out for a while..",5,5
289,new bt series from oberwerk,Baffling between the objective up to the front prism face is good. Most refractors have those baffles but they shouldn't cut into the light path and decrease effective aperture. The baffles I'm speaking of are located between the Schmidt roof prisms and the rhomb turrets to block off axis light right ahead of the rhombs. Those bright reflections in the APMs are off the rhomb faces as indicated by their angular locations around the exit pupils.. Rich.,4,3
290,celestron binoculars,"Car rides should be no problem. I've traveled some with all of my binocs, except for the big 25x100s. Though I wouldn't hesitate to take them for a drive, as they came with a nice padded hardcase.. One time I had my Orion Resolux 7x50s sitting on the back seat. I had to brake hard and they zipped forward off the seat and fell about one foot onto the floor mat. I was nervous but collimation was still fine when I got to my dark sky spot. Lesson learned though- I now set them on the back seat floor mat when I take them in the car. Nowhere for them to fall!",4,3
291,celestron binoculars,"Saw this review and am now worried about my return, which is scheduled for tomorrow. Are the Cavalry 15x70 better than the Skymaster 15x70- or worse?. I was thinking of returning my Skymaster 15x70 to get the Cavalry edition. Do you think it's a worthwhile upgrade? I have until tomorrow to decide. This review made me nervous.. https://stargazerslo...-cavalry-15x70/. Hi. I waited for the Cavalry to be issued for months, hoping it would be better than the Skymaster for only a few dozen euros/dollars/pounds more but I and a friend were disappointed. He brought it to the field right after receiving it, we compared it against my 16x70 and other binocs. We didn't have a Skymaster or a Skymaster clone on hand, but we used them so often, we remember what the views are like.. Well, the Cavalry was not better, and even a little less good. The image was soft, some pale green ghosting was visible with a near-full Moon, and the eyecups do not match the face bones very well. It's rare to advise against a Celestron optic, but that one is really not great. Some folks in Cloudy Nights reported it loses collimation easily. Seems that these shortcomings explain why its price dropped after a while.. Not tried them personally, but on paper the Helios Stellar-II is close to ideal for a nitro 15x70 that does demand a heavy price..",1,3

Those binos are your wide field twin telescopes. I was looking through my 20x80 tonight, and Andromeda looked great in them. Lying on my back, not hard to hold steady at 5 lbs.. If I were shopping for a wide field small scope, it certainly would be much larger than 80mm.. That's what those 4.25"" Astroscans are for. I don't think Astroscans are that great, but there are a lot of short f/ratio small reflectors out there in the 4"" to 6"" range..

So some of the reviews I was reading I find a little dubious- for example the Barska 20x80 (5 pounds) is easier to handhold than a Nikon 12x60 because the Barska ""distributes the weight better."" Could this be true? The largest camera/lens combo I can hand hold weighs about 2.5 pounds. I'm not sure how that translates to binoculars.

YES! Read On. It's a long thread and worth reading when you have the time.. [4] My answer: Don't do it and don't void your warranty. Send it back for a refund or another sample.. Since Eric has not replied at this time:. [5] The Oberwerk Ultra 15x70 (Kunming-United Optics BA8 Series) is same model binocular I was talking about yesterday. It's individual focus and weighs 5½ pounds. After I mentioned that I had handheld my Garrett-branded version of this hefty binocular, you said: ""I'm suitably impressed that you handheld a 5+ pound binocular. I don't think I could do that."". [6] The right eyepiece includes a diopter adjustment. So, go find yourself a bright star. Then with your right eye closed or the right objective capped, focus the view on the left side with the center focus wheel. When you're satisfied that you have a sharply focused star, close your left eye or move the cap onto the left objective. Now, instead of turning the right eyepiece diopter for a sharp focus, you defocus the view completely. That will produce the BLOB that Eric mentioned. So as Eric said: ""If the star from the left barrel appears outside of the blob, then the binocular is out of collimation."".",4,3
297,celestron binoculars,"Just the 15x70.. I was presenting my actual experience, which contradicted the supposition made by the other poster.. Binoculars are typically designed to have fair-to-good ergonomics for the viewing of subjects that are located in a generally horizontal direction from the viewer. Much of what we want to see in astronomy is located much higher in the sky and the utility of a normal binocular begins to break down severely in those cases. Larger aperture, higher mag and higher weight make the problems worse, even unsolvable perhaps, at least practically..",2,3

When it became known that David Lunt was fighting for his life, it looked to some of us like Meade showed real heart and stepped in and did a good thing for the family. In my mind and maybe others too, right or wrong, it represents something that Meade did I  remember with a warmness that cannot be bought with a million dollars worth of glossy paper and ink and Madison Avenue. But I have to think it was also a good business decision. Coronado had the technology that none else had, David Lunt had invented the solar scope that did not require an oven, and this was Meade's opportunity... there was no other way to get into the field.

351,maksutov versus schmidt,"Got it, thanks. Its just critical reading of a comment about smaller aperture outperforming a larger one. I get both controlled veiling glare and contrast transfer, it's just one of those details that cause one to stop and ponder. To ask...and wonder why larger aperture failed.. Great point, seeing is better supported in my smaller aperture. So, magnification works pretty well.. Another great point. Jupiter is rather bland and not far from grey scale in my 6"" Mak. The defining moment for me was recognizing white features in the zones. If those features are white, then the zone itself (on average) must be a different hue. Off white or grayish, maybe. Once these subtle hues become visible, you can begin to differentiate them as they are not the same hue. Trick is, to figure out what hue they appear to be. One thing is for sure, they are not a glaring white as the EZ appears to be when you first put eyes on Jove.. One interesting thing is, I learned to see the northern region as a slight brownish hue, but the southern polar region appears more grey than brown. Dunno why. Some features in the SEB are not the same color(s) as the larger features within belt itself, more of an off white or cream hue. (I hesitate to use the term ""color"" as it implies something easier to see, like in our back yard.). So, for me, the ""model"" was recognizing smaller features that appeared to be white and work backward from there. At least with the softer contrast features. Once you can differentiate softer contrast features, the amount of detail visible on Jove explodes. It's not like a coloring book with lines defining the features, the features are more softly blended and become apparent with better moments of seeing once we learn to recognize them.. For me, observing white was a eureka moment when it came to observing various hues in Jovian detail other than the equatorial bands... By the way, sky conditions aside, just came in from observing M74 through my 6"" Mak. Apparently there is enough contrast under local conditions to show it readily, along with just enough hints - to determine the presence - of at least one spiral arm. So...I only mention this because I am quite proud of the Mak. But, I hold out little hope of observing the M57 central star.. Sorry, discussing observing is enjoyable..",4,4
352,maksutov versus schmidt,Im looking through my tec 6 and 2 of my C8s on the balcony at Christmas tree lights as it clouded out tonight.  The contrast is definately superior in the mak. Smoother optics results in less light scatter around bright objects.  Also better baffleing seems to be making images seem higher contrast and let's not forget better color purity in the mak as well. The mak is really proving to be a first class scope. The C8s are pretty good examples as well but 2 of my 3 C8s are now for sale.....,4,4
353,maksutov versus schmidt,"Honestly, I doubt it. In that location, just about any scope can work to potential. Damian has said that the view through the eyepiece there equals the final processed image. Living in the tropics now, I understand what he is saying. You get nights of essentially motionless seeing that provide views that are incredible. I imaged Saturn at my location in NC with a 9.25"" I owned in 2005, and then with the same scope at WSP in the Florida Keys. No contest, the Keys picture was better. It looked like what I saw in the eyepiece, with motionless seeing. Mars later that year looked great in my webcam shots, but the detail seen in the images did not come close to what I saw in the eyepiece (they were hands down better with the webcam after processing).. Damian Peach is a great imager, but the tropical island location does indeed help. For him, the Mak would be a waste of money.. C14s from tropical sites really shine on the planets. In the 7-8"" range, Maks are a keeper. In the larger sizes, cost does not provide enough benefit to make them worthwhile in my book. That said, a Matthias Wirth 10"" Mak-Newt I looked through was worth every penny spent. Cool down was very fast, and the views beat every scope on the field.. Tom.",2,4
354,maksutov versus schmidt,"That is my impression, as well. Though I've owned larger aperture SCTs, I've never put them to the test like I did the Mak. So I cannot speak to one being better or worse than the other. But, like you, I have found Maks to be very satisfying given the smaller aperture. It never fails to impress. But, then again, that may well be entirely due to the accommodating tropical climate. Still, one has to ask...is there something about the design that is satisfying? Maybe well corrected and smooth is all there is to it..",4,3
355,maksutov versus schmidt,"After you answer your portability questions and costs you might want to float whether or not you are visual or ccd. If it's both than the SCT might be your best bet. If it's staunchly visual you may prefer the the mak.. Since it's an either / or choice, I'd go with the SCT over an MCT - you'll get more aperture for the same money. SCTs are the ""all'rounder"" portable solution, good at lots of different things..",3,3
356,maksutov versus schmidt,"OK, how's this to keep it going.....I evaluated, observed, and imaged through this 12 inch Intes Alter Mak:. At this location, Mak on left, with a C14 on the right:.",3,5
357,maksutov versus schmidt,"And that last sentence is the definitive statement of all of these scope vs scope threads and 'shootouts'. I happen to feel that regardless of which design I'm using, if I like what I see as I'm peering into the eyepiece, then I'm happy.. I mentioned in another thread that I have gone against conventional wisdom several times when selling off one scope to buy another and have never looked back. Even recently, I sold off my dob and joined the Mak Brigade. Nothing at all wrong with the dob, I just felt like a change and chose a new path. And since switching over to the Mak design I've read over and over again that they're only good for this, but not for that. My experience with them over the past month or so has told me that they're not nearly as limited in their capabilities as some here on CN would have you believe.. Don't get me wrong, I'm not settling for sub-par performance, and I know that each design has it's strongpoints, but I don't feel that I should limit its use to just doubles and planets. It's going to used for everything its modest aperture can show me...all kinds of objects. Just my two cents..",4,4
358,maksutov versus schmidt,"I agree with Bob and Paul, the meniscus is not the real problem, IMO. The internal mirror is, in both designs. It's possible the meniscus may retain a boundary layer for a bit longer, but the internal mirror and structure cannot readily radiate heat to the environment.. I cool my scope with a gel ice pack, it's cool to the touch by observing time. So, I cannot really say whether the meniscus is warmer for longer. The ice pack chills the entire OTA, even dampening the primary mirror enough so that there are absolutely no heat plumes at observing time. In our modest climate, I have not seen a heat plume in years. Nor, to my knowledge or recollection, any evidence of a boundary layer from the meniscus.. However, for whatever reason, even in the tropics, I have not experienced dew on the meniscus. Well, once it picked up a little dew and cleared easily. Even the OTA itself is dry all night. So is the grass, car surfaces, etc. It's pretty dry here during the ""dry"" season. Point being, I think the meniscus is cooled to ambient most of the time, but not below the dew point several degrees below ambient. One evening, my C11 gathered dew and it could not go and stay away. But, that happened only once, as well.. Surely the Schmidt corrector cools more quickly. No doubt. But, so does the meniscus. I'd argue both cool more rapidly than the embedded primary mirror..",3,4
359,maksutov versus schmidt,"[/quote]. I had read here and elsewhere that the Chinese MCTs operated at a little less than their nominal aperture but this note contains two things new to me. I didn't know that the aperture cutoff depended on the diagonal size and using a 2"" diagonal could reduce the aperture by over 3/4 of an inch (for a nominal 180mm MCT). Second, I didn't know that ""better"" Russian MCTs could also be impacted.. Every so often, I ""window shop"" for a complement to my 5"" achro that I can handle and up to now, a 7"" class MCT has been on the list along with an 8"" or maybe 9.25"" SCT and perhaps a 10"" Dob. Considering the ergonomics of use, I'm leaning more to the Cassegrain type telescope but seeing that a 7"" MCT might operate at something less than 6.3"" is a little disconcerting. Should I just stick to looking at the SCTs (or Dob) and forget about the MCT? [/quote]. Yes, the Russian Maks do vignette. The key is that the closer the eyepiece gets to the back of the scope, the less it vignettes. Both the Russian Maks and the original Orion version of the SW180 Mak has 1 1/4"" diagonals. They still vignette with those diagonals, but a 2"" more so, as the eyepiece to back of the scope distance is longer.. I have owned a couple of the Celestron C9.25"" scopes, and have been very happy with them. I found that the longer F/Ratio primary design does make for a nice image. If you have a mount that will handle it, they make a nice all around instrument.. Tom",4,4

My realization was coma was feeding out a lot of the less bright stars to invisibility. When I try to up my eat in a few hours later the difference was just as profound much smaller stars were visible in this eat in instrument / 16.

Also, one might wonder if the reason that setting scopes side by side often gives the expected result is because that result was expected by the observers. I mean, at least some of the time - some of the result is undoubtedly real, but some could be psychological. It is very difficult to separate out the two without some form of objective testing.. It's really a pity that good, blind testing is nearly impossible for astronomy equipment, because it is almost impossible to disguise most of it from the viewer and experienced observers are needed.",3,2

Ok, but thats not because reflectors never can do that! You mentioned ""high quality"", well, there are ""high quality"" reflectors out there too! But, apparently, when you buy a refractor, you have a bigger chance that it gives pinpoint stars.. Its all in factory tolerances one needs to accept.. Also there, new insights can at least minimize the diffraction artifacts in reflectors, certainly when the obstruction is mounted in a lens, schmidt cortector, or parallel optical plate.. With the techniques of today, certainly in 'closed' scopes like SCT and MCT, the coatings will last a lifetime, even two!. Decently built reflectors also need to be collimated once, but indeed probably need a little more respect in handling to keep them collimated, but for most, that extra respect is no problem.. Don't forget that we live in different times now, and that the people who kept their eyes and minds open for new insights, now see that the refractors are not that 'much much better' anymore. Maybe directly from stock they still mostly seem to be, but with a little extra effort, the reflectors surely can be on par.. But, don't get me wrong here, I still very much like refractors too.

The C14 could allow you to go deeper (depending on the image scale you choose), but it's sort of a 'tweener scope:  compact, very good DSO performance (but not as good as relatively larger Newt-Dobs), and the image scale and aperture to potentially provide great planetary views..

399,why do people even buy scts,"Hi Ed,. Great thread, as always. Thank you.. I think I can consider myself as one of the targeted individuals  because I'm modifying/fine tuning my SCT's a lot. I have owned and sold the following SCTs. This was a great optic - not mod'ded it at all. Sold it only because the number of scopes I owned increased a lot  and this one was waiting on the shelf. This was a great scope for on axis views but the off-axis views were disturbing my eyes. I had to fix the rotating baffle tube with the help of Celestron Support, as sending the OTA to US from Turkey was out of question. The only mod I did was replacing the stock focuser with Feathertouch. I sold this scope because C11 Edge was very addictive and offering much more and C9 wasn't getting any use   Flocked inside of the tube, inside of the secondary baffle and applied thermal insulation to the inside and outside of the tube. I also To get the Hyperstar and imaging chip square to the focal plane,  Neither the secondary nor the corrector was centered properly. Maybe they were when they left the factory but not when I received them. The secondary housing was loose and rotating. I had to buy a sorbothane gasket from Starizona to fix the rotation issue and I had to increase the secondary housing diameter by wrapping flocking material around it so that it was centered to the corrector plate. Then I used the tool I built to center all the front elements to the primary. The difference before and after was like night and day for Hyperstar imaging. I have also replaced the stock focuser with a Feathertouch Micro focuser. This was needed to motorize the focuser for autofocusing purposes.. I sold this scope because it was too heavy for me with all the accessories, hyperstar lens and camera attached. I don't have a permanent set up yet and tearing it down after a sleepless night was becoming too risky for me. For visual I was not using it at all since I have a 12"" and 16"" Dobs. After much deliberation, I have decided to downsize to a C8 Edge.. My current SCT park consists of the following:. This one is for pure visual (for the time being) and offers great views with great ease to me and to my girlfriend. Of course, the aperture is 6"" only and you have to select your targets and  adjust your expectations accordingly. I will not modify it unless I want to use it for imaging.. This is my new wide angle, fast imaging scope. Unfortunately, the optics were not aligned to the primary again, despite all the reports that Celestron was making sure all aligned etc. My initial efforts with Hyperstar have been  very disappointing. The scope remained dormant concerning imaging since last may because of this problem. I have used it for visual and the views were amazing indeed. Finally, I managed to build a similar tool I built for my ex C11 Edge, and centered the corrector to the primary. The result was, again, stunning. There is some more work I have to do regarding the Hyperstar mounting but so far, I am very pleased with the result. I will share the details of this in another thread.. I have, again, replaced the stock focuser with a FT one. This time I didn't have to implement my time consuming active cooling system on this scope as Ed made the Tempest fans available for this scope. They were not made yet when I bought my C11 Edge. Replacing the Celestron strainers with the fans was a very easy task and I am quite happy with their performance so far.. I have never owned a Meade SCT so I cannot speak about them. My take on the Celestron SCT's is the following:. Celestron is selling to me a very acceptable product. They excel in some parts, like the optics, and do a so and so job on the other parts, like the focuser, diagonal etc. Their method of assembly may also diminish the final quality of the product, like delivering loose or misaligned optical elements.. However, they offer this package to me at a very acceptable price. There is no way I can produce the corrector plate or the primary with the same precision, if at all.. So, when I buy a new Celestron SCT, I am thankful to them for what they are delivering to me already. Then, I start working on the issues I listed above and I am seeing this as great fun and part of the hobby. You may ask Celestron to do all this for you but then the price may double and put the scope out of your reach. Let Celestron do what they are doing best and  improve and customize the scope yourself for whatever you deem fit.. Hope I was able to explain myself with my inadequate English Clear skies.",4,4

401,ioptron zeq25 initial impressions,"Yep Mike, the power light is lit when I go to slew left, right, up, or down the hand controller says it's is slewing but the motors don't do anything then when I release the arrow button it says stop. Just bad luck, I don't think I going to win the power ball this week either.. And I will have to ship it back to OPT. I'm just bummed because the smoke from all the forest fires has cleared.. I guess I will have to use my other mount until I can get this sorted out.. I will keep you updated.. Happy to here you got your tripod. Eric.",4,2
402,ioptron zeq25 initial impressions,"I think you will be fine visually.  It is the length of the OTA rather than the weight that causes problems with the z25.  At 32 inches, you should be fine.  I agree that the 1.5"" tripod will be fine..",4,3
403,ioptron zeq25 initial impressions,"This is what John at iOptron said when I asked.   That may or may not apply to problems with re-assembly, so you should ask him.. I downloaded Astronewb's videos to my iPad, made sure I had all the tools he suggested (including a magnetic tipped Phillips head screwdriver which is really handy), and set the mount up in the bathtub after duct taping all the openings.  (Those motor screws are really tiny.)  The tuneup went fine..",4,2

I need the 2nd counterweight (which was backordered), but the balance was still close enough to see the Supernova in M82 and get a few pix from my front yard in downtown Boulder.. What a nice mount!!  I love the etched polar scope.  Did a 1-star align and I was good to go for the eve.  M82 popped right in the center of my view.  Then went to M51, M101 and Dubhe.  All right in the dead center.  Love it!. Jim in Boulder.",5,5

407,ioptron zeq25 initial impressions,"My initial experience with mine has not been so positive. I took possession of one this past Thursday. Right out of the gate there was an error on the hand controller at boot up. Just after the iOptron logo on the screen, I would get a ""DEC connection error"" appearing for a few seconds. The mount appeared to work fine after that, but swapping cables did not cure it. There were no obvious problems with the cable connections. The DEC axis also would not lock properly. Luckily, iOpteron and the dealer I bought it from were at an astronomy show two hours away this weekend. I took it to the folks at iOpteron on Saturday, and they replicated the error, and suggested we swap my mount for their floor demo. Their reputation for good support is well-deserved..  Forward to today. I took the replacement mount out on my deck for some solar observing. After a few minutes, it stopped tracking and a new error appeared: ""RA Voltage Overload"" After that, any button press that required RA movement caused the controller to reboot.  I emailed iOpteron support, and got back a reply fairly quickly (and on a Sunday!). I backed off the tension screw on both axis as per their suggestion. I can now slew largely error-free, though not consistently, at 8x, 16x, and 64x. At any other speeds the error comes up immediately. I also hear a lot of cross-talk and chatter from the motors (as does a friend who also bought one this weekend) during and after slewing. I'm thinking that my mount has some power issues. <EDIT> I forgot to mention that the back-light on the hand controller flashes rapidly when a button is held down. This is a new behavior..  Thoughts? Advice? I'm waiting to hear back from iOpteron from my last email. They've been very good at getting back to me with questions and suggestions today. I really want this mount to work as its weight, features, and price are exactly what I was looking for in a mount. I realize that there is an inherent risk in being an early adopter for anything, but this has been a disappointing start for what I hope is a long-term relationship with this promising mount..",1,5
408,ioptron zeq25 initial impressions,"Paul, I saw it. I was asking any others what supplier they used.  You're right, Reid charges about $1 for the spring and $15 for shipping.  I'd settle for USPS first class mail if they offered it!.",3,1
409,ioptron zeq25 initial impressions,"HMM, I wonder how much a worm would cost, please fill us in on the details! Falcon, one thing I notice is that your RA axis is doing a lot of corrections between each grid space, try bringing your RA hys down to 15 and see if that does not smooth out your RA curve.  If seeing is bad, increase exposure time of the autoguider to 2 seconds..",2,2
410,new skywatcher az gti goto wifi mount,"Just got back in. There were just enough sucker holes in the clouds to test alignment and pointing. However, it was my 3rd attempt at N-L alignment that did the trick. The first two attempts were off by quite a bit. The 3rd N-L alignment worked quite well using Arcturus and Polaris. That was followed with a GoTo to Mizar. The GoTo was dead center on target. Then the cloud cover closed the holes so I packed it in. — I love using Sky Safari with the AZ-GTi.. A casual N & L alignment might work OK, But I try to start off as precise as possible (without waiting too much time) getting to true north and level. As for stiction, there is some in my AZ axis, but it doesn’t interfere at all with pointing.. I don’t use the mini pier that comes with the mount. I attach the mount directly to the center column on a Gitzo series 3 carbon fiber tripod. The mount is firmly attached and doesn’t loosen at all when the mount slews. The center column is raised only a few inches so it doesn’t accentuate vibrations, and yet it provides plenty of clearance so the scope never hits the tripod legs..",4,5
411,new skywatcher az gti goto wifi mount,"Thanks Minos.  ASPS is apparently able to connect to the camera and Mount via ASCOM.  It then has an option to take a shot, solve, and sync the Mount in one go... without invoking sharpcap.  I’ll try giving that a go as well.",4,2

My current HTC 10 also does the same thing sometimes, but less often.. Anyway the only solution I've seen is to close the Synscan app, FORGET the mount AP, reconnect to the mount AP, and reopen the app. This usually works right away, but the other day it took about 4 or 5 tries with the M8..

415,new skywatcher az gti goto wifi mount,"May I ask whether you have any pictures of that process? I had to adjust the RA spring gear/worm meshing to avoid too much play in RA, but because the gear appears to be slightly off-center, there are RA angles at which there is some play in RA, and others where the worm and gear are almost binding.

417,new skywatcher az gti goto wifi mount,"I've been using this mount regularly for a month now and am very happy with it. I use a gitzo tripod instead of the standard tripod and it handles my 100mm Tak with 2lb eyepieces comfortably even at 200x magnification.. Tracking and goto are accurate and it's already enabled me to find objects I haven't viewed before such as Neptune and the snowball pn and several galaxies.. Because of the pier issue mentioned earlier I only use this in goto mode not manually and thus avoid this issue completely. Two small issues I have are that the dovetail clamp can't be replaced with something more sturdy (but Tak is fine with standard one, just annoying it marks the dovetail bar) and link with sky safari not great in that you need two iPhones - one running synscan and one running sky safari in order to use sky safari as the goto controller. But I find I just tend to use synscan only.. In summary, I think it's great value and has really changed my approach to observing. Best new Astro release of the year imo..",5,5

Everything below 4kg I tried ( 80ED, ST80, Mak 102, Mak 127, Vixen A80M ) was perfectly fine. The only thing with Vixen was that you could see the motors somehow struggling but this was with previous AZ GTi I had. This new one I have now seems much more ready to move around. I suspect it's kind of lottery on what you get with these since this latest one I have has the issue of unscrewing from the base - previous one didn't have that..",5,5
420,lx80 ra tracking,"Dennis....   your question was:. <<We might want to compare when Tom, David, Jerry, and Kevin got their mounts. Could the ones having the issue of slow RA in polar, all be mounts from the 2nd batch shipped?>>. My LX80 Ordered from OPT on June 20 - in stock and shipped that day (it came with the 6"" SC), and received on June 20.. I am currently in travel status, and am now in Northern Arizona. It is more cloudy here than back home in Tempe, and its raining there !!!  (Actually - it is raining here too.)  So......   no visual opportunity. It will come..",4,3
421,lx80 ra tracking,"Gday Kev.  No need to send a file of the noise, i was more interested in if the motors were intermittently stopping while polar, hence giving the perceived slowdown, whilst still maintaining correct encoder counts. To get a 50% slowdown in tracking, these stops would be easily heard..  As to percentages, when you do a drive train, the scope measures the amount of slop in the geartrain on reversing direction.. The percentage tells the system how much of this to apply as a rapid burst, with the residual being melded into the tracking until it's all used up.. For RA guiding in Polar, it's irrelevant, as the motors never reverse,. but in AltAz or DEC in Polar, correct percentage setting can assist in how long it takes to reverse direction at low speeds..  Andrew.",2,4

423,lx80 ra tracking,"Greetings Andrew.... First.... I must tell you that I chuckle everytime I read one of your posts.   I love the Gday...... OK, yes, i will do that. Recall that Meade was trying to get me to use the LXD mount selection (before we upgraded the firmware). I am going to try that also. In fact, that test is currently running. And yes, had to change the (-) to a (+) there too.. Results of the LXD will be available in about an hour. I will post them as soon as available. Then i will re-configure as an LX-90 and do that one..",4,2
424,lx80 ra tracking,"I agree with all of this, but I think the bigger issue is Meade's apparent attitude (and complete lack of support or interest) towards Nelson's questions, issues, and calls for assistance. I came within a heart beat of ordering one of these mounts too.  I left this hobby a couple of decades ago, mostly due to a telescope that I bought that had outstanding optics, but a mount that could barely hold itself up.   In years gone by the mantra was always ""aperture, aperture, aperture"".  I have now discovered that if you actually want to have ANY success in this hobby, the mantra should be  ""mount, mount, mount"".  Part of me wants to applaud the effort that some of the faithful are putting in to this mount; but mostly I wonder,  ""Wow,  if I had just sunk $800-$1000 into a mount and had this number of challenges would I be returning it."", and likely mothballing my OTA (for another 20 years). Thanks to all, some honestly, some sarcastically, who help steer me away from this mount..",2,3
425,lx80 ra tracking,"David,. Thanks for the info. Glad you got things going that well. It does confuse me some with what I saw last night using Kevin's laptop to guide with. We have more variance that your pictures show. We still had some star movement back and forth in RA unguided - had PHD only connecting to the DSI pro I with the fine grid overlaid and watched it run.. The guiding had one pleasant surprise in that the DEC axis was quite good - PHD only had to send very small corrections. We've had more issue with DEC on the LXD55 - balance and backlash I think with it. We had hoped the LX80 would an improvement.. As Kevin mentioned earlier, the RA with the LX80 was still an issue for us. We never see RA in PHD graph bounce around  with the LXD55 like we did last night with the LX80.. I tried playing with different settings but never was happy with the results.. As a reference, the attached is from a screenshot of the PHD graph from using the LXD55 at the end of June - 2 second exposures. Both of those axis did well that night. We always have the LXD55 do that well in RA.. The LX80 last night using the exact same camera/guide scope, had the DEC axis do as good as that LXD55 example or better. The RA however was not stable no matter what settings we tried. It would go up and down. We had some finer squiggles but we had highs and lows that were 2 and 3 graph divisions both directions from the center line, that also got that far in a very short time. We had some settings that got farther off both directions than that. Using the DSI pro I, through the Astro-Tech 66mm F6.0 is 4.45 arc-seconds a pixel.. I tried both reducing the RA aggressivenes (steps all the way down to 15% - which did even worse) and increasing it to over correct (120% - which did help some). It also helped some when I reduced the guide camera exposure to unrealistic short times (had a bright star in the field I could still use - times too short to use in real imaging - not enough stars that bright to see with such short exposures). That should have had it chasing seeing but actually improved things some. It seemed the more agressive the guiding attempt, the better. Sending corrections as quickly as possible but not overly long correction with each correction - got the smallest amplitude on the graph.. I also eliminated the chance of it being balanced too well and rocking back and forth in backlash by moving the counterbalance some to ensure it was a little heavy to the east.. We don't think we did a screen shot of the graph last night but he had the logging enabled. We have not had a chance to dig into the log yet..",2,5
426,lx80 ra tracking,"Hi Michael....  Neilson alerted me to your post. I watched your video, and listened to an all to familiar sound. And I have read that you identified the problem..  I can show you what is going on... pic below. The motor is NOT mounted using the conventional external(to motor) mount holes, which indeed, are present. The one at center bottom of the motor is NOT accessable, as the populated gear box is in the way. The screws that ARE used, must be put in BEFORE the encoder PC board is inserted (glued?), and are thus also NOT ACCESSABLE.  In my case, the motor was loose. I think mine was damaged from the collapse. Not so sure now. But damaged beyond repair. This condition is NOT REPAIRABLE. And, after studying the situation further, it is also NOT ACCEPTABLE. It your mount experienced this, and was not dropped, bumped, or otherwise ""banged""... then it is a weak link, and that will affect all users at some point in time..  Added by Edit:  I should state that what has occurred is that one or both of the two small motor attachment screws (see photo) have torn loose from the plastic next to the PC board. If the motor is still ""sort of attached"", then one screw (and thus the motor) is loose, and can move aroundd, resulting in the ""clunking"" of the gears, or at times, total non-alignment of the gears (as in no DEC movement)..",1,5

If the bug is in the firmware, it may end up biting anyone with those types of scopes as well ( incl me   ).. And i was really looking at getting an LX80 to replace my EQ6 as its more flexible for what i do, so learning about its quirks early helps me out as well.. The fact it affects some users and not others in the LX80s doesnt give me a good feeling yet as to whats causing it,. but my money is still on the motorcards.. Andrew.",2,4

431,celestron starsense,"Hi Rod,. Yes, they have obviously based Skyportal on one of the lesser of the three versionsof the Skysafari app, with a small catalogue. I guess it's possible we could see a Pro version of the Syportal app eventually, based on thePro version of Skysafari,a version that would likely have to be paid for I imagine. I'll bring the idea of a Pro version up with the Celestron people I work with doing beta testing.. I have Skysafari Pro and it has a massively bigger catalogue thatwouldwork betterfor more experienced astronomy hobbyists. Skyportal is I suspect (and hope) going tohave a long development future that sees a lot of developments eventually, and this first version has I think probably been deliberately kept simple so they had somethingreadyin time to beavailable with the new wifi Evo mounts, and to finally replace the defunct SkyQ app for people who have been waiting until now with unuseable SkyQlink wifi accessories for other mounts.. Despite its limitations, and current lack of an ASPAroutine, the app seems to work quite well for me so far both on my iPad mini and my two Android devices and on all three of my Celestron mounts, once I got used to not having physical buttons and working out how to hit thevirtual onscreen buttons unsighted while looking through an eyepiece.

Not to take anything away from the programmers at Celestron who I'm sure are doing the best they can to correct the software with the resources available, it's hard not to believe that management considers this to be a low priority issue, given how long it's taken to fix.

434,celestron starsense,"Hi brokenwave.. If you can wait I think it might be best if you hang on till your team celestron account is approved and look there for yourself, as it should then be fairly obvious to you at that stage what the latest firmware versions are, and what they are designed to fix. I suggest that because the latest versions and problem fixes available there today might not be the latest versions in a day or two when you get approved and given access to the SSA areas.. When you ask what is the latest version that is actually working the answer isn't that simple yet, and depends on your model of mount(s), whether you have Eq or alt-az or both types of mounts, possibly whether you are northern or southern hemisphere, and possibly other factors as well. It might be hard to find any one person who can tell you the answer for your configuration right now because of all the variations. Celestron seem to be working on fixes for the problems all the time and are talking fairly regularly to people in team celestron now, so you will find a whole pile of up to date information on various mounts and how they seem to be working with SSA units once you are on the site properly and have had a good read of the SSA threads there..

440,ioptron cem60 first impressions,"Gday Paul.   Loads OK into PHDLab and my app.. The guiding shows that most of the underlying slow woofs that were seen in Alfreds data have been removed, but the raw data is still oscillating at up to 5arcsec pk-pk, and on average it is about 2.5 arcsec pk-pk. Also a few odd spikes at times. That said, it also looks like the guider is running at near 6.7 arcsec/pixel and you are collecting frames at about 2.4 clock seconds, so that may also mask the true shape of the high freq ripple. Either way its certainly not showing sub arcsec results when guided, not even close.. Andrew Johansen Melbourne Australia.",4,4

445,ioptron cem60 first impressions,"I'm confused as to the appeal of the EC version?  Don't you still have to guide even with the EC mount? At least with larger long FL scopes?.  If your guiding I would think that you would just require smooth, and consistent tracking with decent P to p PE. I could see wanting the better numbers if you got them purely by higher precision, but in this case you just correcting twice using dual methods. Seems sort of redundant, and untidy not to mention more expensive..",2,3
446,ioptron cem60 first impressions,"Paul, the dark creation process is actually greatly improved in v2.3.0. If you go to the Darks menu and select Dark Library it'll bring up a Dark Library Creation dialog. On that dialog box you can select a range of exposure durations and exposure times. When you click Start PHD2 will iterate over each exposure step (which you'd normally see in the exposure drop down) and take as many darks at each step as you've requested. So, for example, you can select 0.5s to 10s with 30 darks for each step and PHD2 will completly automate the building of the dark library for every exposure in-between. There's also a bad pixel map library as well..",4,3
447,ioptron cem60 first impressions,"The only experience I have with encoders is a TDM (Telescope Drive Master) which places a encoder on the RA shaft. From my understanding when guiding any correction from the guider is ignored. As the TDM knows it was sent by the guider and doesn't correct for it. So I'm making an assumption (you know what that means) that the 60 works in some what the same the manner. That's it's on/correcting all the time, but ignoring/not correcting during the guide command. The great thing with my setup is that my typ guide exposure is 10 to 15 sec just to take care of any seeing conditions and such. I'm also watching this mount close to see how the testing works as it appears to a very nice unit and iOptron is listening to input. Any how that how I understand the encoder on my mount works.. CS,.

450,cgx rollout thread,"We have to note that Dave fears that flexure in his deck may have caused some movement of the mount. However, if flexure was not the problem then it seems likely he was observing PE in his crosshair EP:. The star drifted further to the left in the 15min interval than in the 26min interval. This could only be caused by PE (if a tracking error rather than deck flex) since PA error would show drift at a constant rate and the 26min interval would show more drift than the 15min interval..",2,3
451,cgx rollout thread,"I disagree... This is a topic for another thread but briefly I think astronomy has just as much potential as ever. The problem is that everything in astronomy today is antiquated (wrt to user interface and design) compared to the innovation in user interfaces happening in consumer products. The folks in the hobby who have been using these products for 30-40 years don't realize this and the problem is compounded by the fact that they hang out with people their own age and think that is the whole community. They suffer from serious selection bias.. I am not saying companies are not innovating. Celestron is trying really hard. Then there are many new startups like TinyMos and Unistellar which are trying to change the way people interact with telescopes. But innovation is much slower vs. other consumer markets as the dollars are small. I work in mobile semiconductors and am aware of this first hand. My company's annual R&D budget is $4B which is significantly more than what has been spent by all astronomy manufacturers combined since.... like forever.. Whether these startups or others with more innovative ideas succeed, this is the direction the hobby needs to go in. Many mature astronomers used to their way of doing things and set in their ways will not agree and that is exactly the problem... they are not able to see this hobby through a young person's eyes..

Like many others I was curious what difference a premium mirror would make but I had no intention of spending the money to find out because I wasn’t necessarily unhappy with what I had. Then as luck would have it I was given an opportunity by Carl Zambuto to try one of his mirrors in my scope at no cost or obligation to me. I had no problem seeing a difference between his mirror and mine. I kept his. One of the things that stood out immediately was how much easier it was to see the spiral arms in M51. The contrast difference was incredible. It sounds a bit too cliche to describe the difference as a veil being lifted from the view but that describes it perfectly. I have no idea how good or bad my mass produced mirror was and I don’t care. What I do know is the Zambuto was noticeably better and it didn’t take looking at Jupiter in good seeing to notice the difference..,4,5

Observers in other locations, particularly more northerly locations probably do not have the sort of long periods of steady seeing you and I often experience. They have to wait for those moments of clarity.. As far as the worth of a premium mirror.. Good optics are always a plus.

For the most part they hold collimation better, and during set up, collimation is also much closer to where you left off the last time you viewed. I have owned a 4, and an 8 inch solid tube newtonian. Cats are also solid tube. Truss Dobs have more options for storage--there are more niches for them to fit into.

543,jupiter appears like half circle,"Ok, yes, i thought i deleted those though. I'll double check. I was making replies, but they seemed to be replies to myself. Ok, that makes sense to me now. You can only raise or lower the secondary in order for it to position itself under the focus tube. But you can't keep raising/lowering it anymore than that. That's where i have it...centered (at least until i check again once collimator arrives). The only thing to do other than that, is to lower the primary mirror, which i did. I don't know for sure, but i would think what i did lowering the primary by an inch or so, quite a bit, would have helped some of the illumination loss onto the secondary. But I could not see any difference before/after of the focusing distance with the 24mm eye piece. I still had to extend it out of the focus tube about the same. Almost doesn't make sense. It should have..",2,3
544,jupiter appears like half circle,"Correct.. But moving the secondary up of down the tube, at this point, even if necessary as seen in the collimation tool, would only gain a millimeter or two at best, so is no longer a consideration..",2,3

I think all of this is not that significant, and i probably would not even notice any difference between the way it is and moving the primary so more light hits the secondary. I'd like to do that sure, but i don't want to end up making any big mistakes or having any mishaps like dropping something on the mirror..",2,4

At first is creeps and then later, it slips from your day-to-day consciousness and suddendly it is found to be nearing completion. This has been the case with my 20"" f/3 Lockwood/JP Astrocraft scope. In about 3 weeks, it will have gone through the final completion stage.  We did however get first light in Central Illinois this past weekend when I went up to look at the progress and provide further input into some of the design features. It is so feature laden for visual, astrovideo, binoviewing and DSLR applications that I will save that for another post..  The scope has a Lockwood 20"" 1.25"" thick Pyrex f/3 primary coupled with a 5"" m.a. Lockwood secondary. The JPA custom mirror cell was tested by Lockwood under various bench conditions with the unfinished primary and has been optomized for the thin mirror to operate in all positions. The mirror cell is a work of art all by itself with the use of spherical bearings on each triangle and roller bearings on the lower mirror edge supports. Views of Jupiter's GRS and surrounding ovals at 219x under less than ideal conditions still showed very detailed and colorful images. The unfinished podium on the non-viewing side includes wired and wireless handpands, 12"" ultrabook computer, power supplies for the computer and eventually a heated shield that will prevent the computer screen from dewing up. All wiring is internally routed and the entire scope will be powered by one external 12v wire going into the powered ground board..  Mike Lockwood, the optician on this project, is a former electrical engineer/research scientist/ATM that went into the optical business and is building what are arguably some of the finest and most consistent sub f/4 optics on the planet in sizes up to 60"" and f ratios as fast as f/2 (he recommends no faster than f/2.75 for Newtonians and I have viewed through one of his 28"" f/2.75's that was an absolute stunner).

By the time you add all this stuff to your budget scope, it's no longer budget, especially when you consider having to get the primary refigured as well.

Not saying here that's quite the way the TOS are framed or constitute an exclusive description of of what's covered thereunder, but nonetheless that would be a paradigmatic example.. Nevertheless, it happens in here all the time that members post (objectively) critical comments about a particular vendor's product who is known (or widely suspected) to frequently monitor relevant CN forums, with specific intent of thereby (hopefully) pressuring that vendor to make changes.  Sometimes these quickly evolve into a de facto collective campaign by like-minded forum members.  There are two currently ongoing threads of this nature over in the eyepieces forum, one about the insistence of certain EP manufacturers (most especially ones with green logos) of including vexatiously problematic undercuts on the barrels of their EPs.  There's another about the allegedly poor quality of eyepiece caps on a certain maker of high-end premium EPs (who coincidentally has a green logo)..

The verdict was lambda/7 RMS and lambda/1.2 PV with a Strehl of 0.58 (or 0.5 accounting for the 27% obstruction). The main reason for the low numbers was a pronounced astigmatism which the reviewers ascribed to the deformation of the primary under its own weight. A residual waverfront error of lambda/15.7 RMS was also reported, which showed various zones and a ""print through"" pattern of the mirror's 12 radial supports.

I have been doing solar system imaging with the SW 16"" flextube goto Dob for years and have been very happy with the results, so I upgraded into the 20"" Stargate goto Dob little more than a year ago.

I still have the 16"", so for several times I set the 16"" and 20"" side by side for Lunar imaging, using the same imaging train, and 16"" gives sharp focus, 20"" not. Realising there is something wrong, I started taking star test images, and the results were clear: The 20"" mirror is having some sort of zonal error and a huge print through from the mirrors internal rib structure. And by huge I mean that you can actually see the mirrors structure in the defocused star when the seeing settles for a moment.... Below is Dubbhe with ir-pass filter and ASI183MM camera + 1,5x Barlow. The 12 ribs of the mirror or 12 areas between the ribs create 12 bright blobs to the defocused star. And the focused star has 12 blurred and distorted star images around and on top of it.. If this was not enough, when the star is defocused more, you can see the actual mirror structure in the image! Below is defocused Dubbhe and for comparison image of the main mirror I loaded somewhere from this forum (I havent removed my mirror at any point, it's as it was delivered from the factory).

To experiment, you could try ""stop down"" the Cheshire, using a ""donut"" stop of perhaps 2 mm larger inner diameter than the inscribed circle (where you put that stop depends on the design - but if you put it inside the focal plane, you get a ""balancing"" effect for tilt like with the barlowed laser - nice, though hardly significant in practice).

[quote]...having collimation that is more accurate can help compensate for collimation shifts that occur in many scopes' mechanicals during the night as the scopes are shifted in altitude and mechanical flexures and movements occur.

No argument there. I would like to call this ""improper"" usage, but too many manufacturers encourage this practice.. [quote]...the use of a laser/barlowed laser combination doesn't result in the same degree of accuracy as the autocollimator, even if the laser is accurate enough.  If two tools quickly result in the same effect: collimation good enough to show good star images, but one is more accurate/sensitive than the other, then the latter is the superior tool.  That doesn't mean that both techniques don't work, merely that one technique is inherently more accurate than the other.[/quote]. Again, I use the tools redundantly, and when I take the time to get the Glatter (with 1mm aperture stop)  aligned with the CatsEye triangle, I find that the Infinity XL autocollimator also shows perfect alignment about 60- or 75-percent of the time. I'm not suggesting that everyone's results will be the same as mine, only that it can be done. For a novice user, the autocollimator may seem more like an exercise in frustration. But if they're not achieving the necessary level of alignment precision to realize their scope's performance (""...my 4-inch refractor outperforms my 8-inch Dob""), the autocollimator is just showing them that they need to do a better job.  [quote]One tool, which I wish was in production, eliminates many of my above objections to the use of a laser for primary collimation: the focused Krupa collimator (      ).  This tool could easily replace the barlowed laser for primary collimation.  It should be relatively cheap, too, since an LED is going to be inexpensive to obtain and manufacture.[/quote]. I personally feel that we can already achieve the necessary level of precision for axial alignment with a variety of tools that are available today.. [quote]...Passive tools can be safely used to collimate and they are not prone to miscollimation, are easier to use (personal judgment there), and in the case of the autocollimator possessed of a higher degree of accuracy with greater mechanical simplicity than the equivalent barlowed laser technique.[/quote]. Playing the devil's advocate from this side of the fence--I  use a Barlow attachment on my Glatter laser anymore--the 1mm aperture stop shows  axes simultaneously. I also rarely use my Cheshire anymore. I use my TeleCat XL combo tool and Infinity XL autocollimator about equally (people should really use a good sight tube to evaluate the secondary mirror alignment more often!) and the Glatter with 1mm aperture stop almost exclusively after dark for axial spot checks.. [quote]Use what you like and patience will pay off with the goal of collimation that produces your scope's best images.. But put me down as a passionate advocate for passive tools rather than lasers. [/quote]. And I truly hope your passion never wanes!",3,4
597,catseye vs howie glatter and blug,"Actually, I've pondered the concept of a ""no-pupil"" AC mirror for a long time.  The compromise is that typical 1-way (sometimes called 2-way) mirrors are made by actually reducing the reflective film deposit thickness sufficiently to allow light transmission (for viewing through the mirror) which of course will reduce the reflectivity.  We certainly don't want to (literally) ""loose sight"" of that 4th image so important to the CDP.. It's possible a 1-way mirror scenario may act as a ""projection screen"" much like the Barlowed laser return screen eliminating parallax error and the need for a small pupil..",4,2

On a perfect night of viewing, you really don't want to leave collimation to chance and the Catseye Tools are the second level of verification if you use the Glatter first and the Glatter can be the second line if you use the Catseye first.  Redundancy, but if one catches an error in the other and the seeing is pristine, it isn't a wasted effort.

600,review binoviewers zeiss baader william optics siebert denkmeier,"Hi George,. yes, Binotron is easiest bino to collimate of all binos.. Denks I and II:. some have GLUED eyepeice holders to binobody, so cant be collimate by shiftig eyepeice hodlers, so only by shifting prisms. But, Denks I and II are limited by movement prisms inside, so could be impossible to collimate them properly if eyepeice holders are glued/placed wrongly.. Some Denks I and II does not have glued eyepeice holders so collimation can be done by shifting them by releasing 3 little - screws on each holder.. Mark V:. its impossible to collimate it originally by yourself. Its possible to collimate it by subtile shifting eyepeice hodlers if you have proper tools for dissasamble each holder, and even them, its hard to do collimation.. Collimation Mark V by shifting prisms, is umpossible job becasue prisms are blocked by 2 tiny non acessibile screws.. Here, these screws must be completly removed by dissasambling whole bino in parts, to be possible do collimation by shifting prisms. In process of Supercharge I remove these screws, so collimation can be easily done by shifting prisms.. About collimation any bino:. yes, all we have more or less IPD. If you perfectly collimate bino for your purpose, it does not mean it will work for all other observers with different IPD.. Here, I do perfect collimation of all binoviewers I do Supercharge, by my IPD, and sometimes, very rarely happened that guys tells me that bino arrived out of collimation after shipment. In this case I provide collimation instructions how they can do it easily at home with bit playing.. Here, not only different IPD can casue not perfectly merged image for each of us, but as well shipping! Even subtile shift of prisms can casue to get bino out of collimation due shock in process of shipping. And yes, very often this happened with even newely purchased binoviewers.. Hope this helps..

620,are binoviewers just as great on dsos,"I suspect your scope was in a severe apeture reduction mode, especially if you were using a reducer.. You can't use a reducer with the EdgeHD 8""either without apeture reduction. On my own EdgeHD, light path has to be kept to about 165mm or so for full apeture. Now someone else measured no apture reduction at this back focus, so it may vary a bit, but a reducer is almost sure to cause between5"" and 1"" of apeture reduction, and perhaps more.. And I suspect that this was happening to your 6"". My bet is that you were loosing a lot of aperture, and I would bet that with a5 compressor, it was more than an inch and perhaps an inch and a half.. Remember, there is a lot or light in the outside of the light cone, and cutting an inch not only reduces the light at the focal plane, but it has the same effect as making the central obstruction larger by diameter. If your scope was 33% obstructed, if you were loosing an inch of apeture (from about 28 square inches to about 19 square inches of light collection, or a 30% decrease in collection), but you also have to figure that the secondary now becomes more like a 39% obstruction.. I don't know if this was what was happening to you, but based on my own result with sever apeture reduction, I would guess that it is what was happening with your configuration.. I use a 10mm SCT to T2 adapter, a Baader standard prism, and a Mark V in my EdgeHD 8"" and I am just barely shy of being at full apeture, but it is very close, and maybe within the margin of error.. Anyway, you need to decide what is important to you, but if a wide field is important to you, an f/5ishNewtonian with a Denk II Super System is the best combination.. Now with the SCT, you can still get a low power view, but it won't be a wide field view. If you want a brighter image, then you can use a pair of 40mm Plossls, or (what I think is a better choice) a pair of 35mm Ultimas/Ultrascopics. Either of these will give you a very big exit pupil. The Ultrascopes/Ultima may vignette a tiny bit in the Denk IIs. Don't know, have not tried them in a Denk II. Either of these will give you a much lower power and a bigger exit pupil to help brigten up things a bit. I just did not like the 40s becuase the apparent field was a bit to small even for binoviewing. The Ultima/Ultrascopes work beautifully with the EdgeHD 8"" in the Mark Vs. The field is only a very tiny bit bigger than with ES 24/68s, butthe bigger exit pupil is a nice thing for nebula.. My advice though is to avoid using any kind of reducer for normal viewing with an SCT, and instead, accept some apparent field loss and get your low power with 35mm Ultimas or with 40mm Plossl..",4,4

Most people would not consider spending $3500 or more on this kind of solution.. I have the $3500 to spend I guess, but I have gone back and forth on this before. I am a visual observer. I like sitting at the eyepiece because I feel like I am experienceing the sky ""in person"".. If I were to put a peice of technology between myself and the sky that processes the view and presents it to me in an altered fashion, then why not just put an image intensifier camera in the eyepeice holder and stay inside and view it on my computer monitor..

I am not at all saying it is in any way wrong for anyone else to choose to enjoy an electronically augmented reality. That is not at all my intention with this response..

So the thing with the diopters- I have them bottomed out and snug. above the diopters is the SC locking ring. even with the diopters snug and lock collars snug, the baader zooms still spin. this is because the baader zoom body actually spins freely by itsels. at the bottom of the baader zooms, there is a thin knurled ring that is part of the nose piece assembly. above this thin knurled ring, is the zoom body housing. the whole housing rotates on top of this knurled ring. and it is not loosening or tightening by turning it, it just turns. so the body rotates even with EP locked in, and diopters snug. make sense? one needs to hold the lowr part of zoom body, then twist the click zoom ring..",3,3

630,custom made adapter denkmeier to baader t 2,"***** UPDATE *****. I called Russ Lederman at Denkmeier this afternoon and had a lengthy discussion concerning the adapter threading issue.. I also met with Pierre (the machinist) after talking with Russ.. He tried to give me the plausible explanation.. Point 1: the Denk and Denk II binoviewer threads that the custom adapter threads into were made with different materials over various iterations of the binoviewer - early version, initially softer brass and later versions, harder aluminium. All the Powerswitchs were made with aluminium. Meaning: if your threads are brass on your specific binoviewer, they are  softer than aluminium and the aluminium adapter will thread in much easier.. I met with Pierre and asked him to look at the binoviewers  - my Denk Std & Denk II (back from by friend ) as well as my friend's Denk II/Powerswitch.. My Denk Std has brass threads. logo is white background with 2 circular black circles with a galaxy in each one : purchased 2003. DENKMEIER DEEPSKY BINOVIEWER OPTICAL CO.. My Denk II (purchased used  4/05 - unknown production date) also has brass threads - logo on my Binoviewer reading from top to bottom is as follows: DENKMEIER DEEPSKY. DIELECTRIC-COATINGS. BINOVIEWER. OPTICAL. engraved white on black background. Both of my units have had at least 9 - 11 years of usage.. My friend's Denk II has aluminium threads and the logo says DENKMEIER II. in white colour on a black background. The adapter barely threads on my friend's Denk II.. Obviously different production runs and different thread material.. Point 2: Denkmeier's Production facilities have move from Maryland to NY. He has used different CNC machines at each facility.. He has also employed many different machinists over the years. Denkmeier has a ""production tolerance"" as Russ stated but he wouldn't elaborate any more on exactly what that meant. Because of these small tolerance issues (he specifically mentioned 1.25"" & 2"" adapters as well as the refractor correctors for the William Optics 2"" diagonals) that he has simplified his current production on the BINOTRON binoviewer - one binoviewer/accessories- one machinist. He said he is extremely happy with all new production tolerances - in one word - consistent.. Russ also mentioned that he always wanted each purchaser (whatever the product/s) to be purchased at the same time (if possible) so that each system was tested for fit prior to shipment.. He didn't have complete control of this because the units/accessories were sold from Denkmeier directly as well as through various retailers.    Russ now only sells direct from Denkmeier - no more retailers. Complete sales control as well as purchasing advice.. What does this all mean to those CN members that the adapter doesn't fit.. Each Denkmeier Binoviewer/Powerswitch is unique. Different units have different threads (brass vs aluminium) and all are within ""production tolerances"". Since some adapters fit perfectly vs barely threading on means that each unit maybe slightly different in the thread diameter/pitch.. There are many small problems that have compounded.. I did not know that the threads on my binoviewers were made of brass rather than the newer aluminium version.. Both of my Denkmeier Binoviewer units have 9 - 10 years usage with different adapters being threaded on and off many times.. Both adapters have the softer brass internal threads and they may have worn slightly. How much - who knows.. This caused the adapter to be very slightly larger in diameter - how much?. enough to cause the adapter not to thread in all units.. We have the potential ""production tolerance"" from Denkmeier.. We also have the move by Denkmeier to a new facility as well as different machinists being employed.. Who knew how difficult it was to make one adapter fit the various Denk products.. Because of all the forementioned variables, in hind site the only perfect solution was to make a custom adapter for each specific Denkmeier Binoviewer/powerswitch from each CN member -that is why one adapter costs well over $100.00 US.  Pierre has looked at various options to solve the threading problem.. Making a production part to rethread the adapter is not feasible  - too expensive to make as well as having all the adapters returned, rethreaded and then mailed out. The other option that mentioned was to have this part made and mailed from person to person to correct the problem - all CN members are not machinists with the access to proper equipment and knowledge. This is not an option.. Pierre has the remaining adapters at the shop. He also has the Powerswitch - it is the tightest fit for the adapter - it barely threads on. He has offered to try the following on one adapter: remove the anodizing, buff down the threads (thereby reducing the diameter) and rethreading the grooves - he called the procedure - ""CHASING the THREAD"" He will see if it will thread into the Powerswitch. He will do this at no charge (very generous indeed). He is pretty confident that this will work on the Powerswitch that he is using.. If it works then he will perform the same procedure on the other adapters - again at no charge. This will make the adapter this specific Powerswitch -. it may still not fit other Powerswitchs or Binoviewers.. If this is unsuccessful, he will make a completely new adapter and leave it non-anodized to remove any possible anodizing issue with the thread.   I'm not sure if there will be a charge for this - I didn't ask at this point.. I will discuss this with him if we get to the point of making new adapters. I'm hoping that the rethreading  will work and that it will fit all the non fitting units in question. If the rethreading is successful, these new adapters will need to be mailed out. I am only asking that the actual mailing fee be incurred since Pierre has graciously offered to rethread the adapters even though all the thread problems are not his fault. I am doing my best from my end.. I'll keep everyone posted on Pierre's progress.. Gary.",2,3
631,custom made adapter denkmeier to baader t 2,"Here is what you see in Gary's picture of his Denks mounted on the wedge.. He as the custom made T2 adapter attached to his Denk using the theads at the bottom in the normal manner, though because the thread at the bottom of the power switch is the same, the custom T2 Adapter could of course be mounted there just as easily.. Next, the sliver thing you see in Gary's picture with the knurled edges is the Baader ""Quick Connect Ring"". This is used for attaching the Maxbright (or any binoviewer or other component, like an eyepiece holder) to the Quick Connector. This is the silver ring you see in the attached picture, but again, this one is the Baader one, so it has T2 threads on top, and more importantly, a big hole in the middle, which is what makes it possible to use it on eyepeiece holders and stuff.. The bottom piece is the Quick Connector itself. You can see that Gary has this mounted to the top of his T2 connector on top of the wedge.. A custom made Quick Connect Ring dovetail for the Denk would allow you to eliminate the T2 to Denk custom adapter and instead use the dovetail to connect to the top of any diagonal using a quick connetor screwed on to the T2 threads.. Likewise, this would allow a Newt onser with an older binoviewer and no power switch to utilize the Baader 1.7x Newtonian GPC for their Newts if they could not find a used power switch and wanted to still use the Denk in the Newt.. And it would allow them to very easily swap the binoviewer back and forth..",4,3

634,custom made adapter denkmeier to baader t 2,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galling. Aluminum threads should basically never be left untreated. Basically, it can start without warning, and essentially weld the pieces together.. Lubrication is not a very good solution in this case, because lubricants can outgas over time leaving a film on your optics that could permanently damage them. The proper thing to do is to have the part surface treated like with anodizing (which can be clear)... or make the part out of brass or steel.. This adapter is basically a perfect storm situation for galling. Unprotected AL threads, with super fine pitch, and a large diameter (which encourages using a lot of torque), and nowhere for any friction induced heat to dissipate..",2,3
635,custom made adapter denkmeier to baader t 2,"Well, I have had my adapter for many months now, and will finally have a chance to try it.. I just bought a very old Denk binoviewer (so old that it had slip focus rather than diopters) and my intention is to put this on my Lunt 60 using the T2 adapter (reached focus with the Binotron mounted directly, so should be no problem). I only use one pair of eyepeices in the lunt, so the slip focus is totally OK. Will just leave it full time on the lunt.. The Maxbrigths are going to the solar wedge so I can get it to work on the 127ED. I need all of the in-travel I can get for the wedge if I expect it to reach focus even with the 1.7x GPC on the 127ED.. If it works out, then I can sell the 110ED. If I can't get a configuration that shows full disk, I will keep the 110ED for that role.. Anyway, binoviewer is on the way, and I should have it in a couple of days, and will report back. I had removed the anodizing form mine, but since this is a very early Denk binoviewer, I am keeping my fingers crossed that it does not have some odd thread size..",4,4
636,custom made adapter denkmeier to baader t 2,"And the powerswitch.    It is hard to describe how much better the powerswtich makes using binoviewers..  Just so much less effort and so much more poductive than changing eyepcies all the time.    A good pair of used Denk IIs of course is a great alternative to both systems.  The Denk IIs are opcially ecellent.  They lack the bigger prism f the Mark V, but they are superb binoviewers..  I have had some of my best Jupiter observations in my 12"" dob using an old pair of Denk IIs.   No one shoud consider these older unit to be so greatly inferrior to the Mark V or Binotron as to dismiss them. In use, the view is almost identcial when using the Denk IIs..

639,custom made adapter denkmeier to baader t 2,"The dovetail needs to be used with the Baader Quick Connector. This part has T2 treads that go on to the diagonal, and the binoviewer wiht dovetail would go on to that.. Looks like this when it is installed. This is the same adapter as shown in the above pictures being mounted on to the quick connect ring.. In Gary's picture of his binoviewers on his wedge, you see that he has installed the Baader Quick Connect Ring into the end of the binoviewer. It is the silver piece just below the custom adapter.. Then, he has the Quick Changer on top of the wedge, and you can see that I have the same part on my wedge.. This change eliminates about 10mm of light. It allows for quick changing of the binoviewer to another diagonal, or quick mouting of other devices (eyepiece holders for example) to the top of the diagonal, but make it quick, your devices would all need to have a Quick Connect Ring installed.. This also allows for easy rotation of the binoviewer.. This would cost more because you would have to have the dovetail and you would have to buy the quick connect ring. For people that will be going back and forth to mono-vision, easier jus to leave the binoviewer on a dedicated diagonal, and swap out the entire package....",4,4

641,new william optics binoviewer on the way,"Just in case you did not know, they also make another adapter that is still short, 15mm that will allow you to rotate the unit. I have the 10mm. but wish I had bought the 15mm, but no big deal..",4,3
642,new william optics binoviewer on the way,"Further tests with the 10-inch F/5 GSO reflector show that it comes to focus with a 2X Celestron Barlow lens set threaded into the nose piece of the binoviewer. No other combination of Barlows, coma corrector or OSC would come to focus. But with the 2X Barlow the view of open cluster M37 was way too magnified for the size of the object. With the 100 mm of extra spacing from Barlow lens to eyepieces the Barlow amplification was more like 4X to 5X. So use of the binoviewer on this telescope will likely be limited to lunar/planetary viewing.. I'm thinking the best telescope for binoviewing will be my Celestron-8 with focal reducer. With binoviewer and the 20 mm eyepieces it gives a FOVof about 3/4°. The C-11 with focal reducer gives a FOV of around 0.55°. Either SCT on my G-11 mount gives a much more favorable eyepiece position compared to the Newtonian on Dob mount..",4,5
643,new william optics binoviewer on the way,"Yes, the coma corrector was used with the extension tube it came with to achieve focus. I hope you are able to get your BV working with what accessories you have available. Let us know what you find.. I have a couple of other configurations that are being explored. It would be nice to find something that is a lower power, wider field. Presently my JMI EV-1 focuser has just 16mm of focus travel. If I get a longer draw tube (for around $40) that travel can be increased. While this focuser is expensive, the fact that it is modular makes it quite flexible in its use.. The photo shows the focuser configured with its SCT attachment base plate.. The next photo shows it attached to the 10-inch GSO Dob..",4,4
644,new william optics binoviewer on the way,"Yes as Spikey131 said, the nosepiece of the WO BV screws off. The RafCamera adapter will close connect the binoviewer to the Baader prism diagonal. Then the 15 mm Baader SCT to T2 adapter will give a near minimum focal path. While it is all expensive, the close connected binoviewer will give some great views with either of my SCTs (C-8 or C-11). So far my costs are as follows:. Yet to be purchased:. The above equipment will close connect the binoviewer and cause then least negative effect on the SCT optical design.Total cost will be $669. That's not too much to be able to get into binoviewing. I've really been enjoying the views so far..",5,4
645,new william optics binoviewer on the way,"Yup, that's what I have, except I use a pair of 20mm and 26mm SP in mine. The 28mm RKE must be cool in the BV! Do they cut any of the corners off?.",4,3
646,new william optics binoviewer on the way,"I'm very much looking forward to joining the ranks of binoviewer users. Except for lower power binoculars, I've never used both eyes simultaneously to examine celestial objects with a telescope. The synergy of two eyes connected to the brain has got to be a fantastic improvement. My favorite right eye will benefit from the extra signal received by the left eye. I'm ready to be awed.. The telescopes to be used will be:. Of course the included 1.6X Barlow can be employed to adjust magnification and FOV.. Recently I have resolved to make the best of observing at home with its Bortle 4.5-5.0 skies. Yeah, there is some light pollution from nearby streets and porchlights. But my garden observing site is shielded from lights directly shining on telescope and observer. I have been considering what might make observing at home more enjoyable:. I chose the binoviewer option as having the least impact on my financial resources as well as on my diminished energy levels. While I'm sure there are discernible benefits to buying a more expensive model, the William Optics binoviewerwill no doubt provide an impressive experience. I've never been one to obsess over small differences in overall performance of optical systems. The human brain can compensate for a lot of the deficiencies present. I'd rather focus on the subject being observed. This is what has kept my passion for astronomy alive for the last 57 years..",4,2
647,new william optics binoviewer on the way,"Tonight I finally had an opportunity to try binoviewing the 1st quarter Moon on my Celestron-11. with the entire assembly of accessories:. There are rubber o-rings on either side of the RAFCamera adapter to allow rotating the BV to a convenient angle. Also the entire BV can be rotated on the prism diagonal's nosepiece within the SCT eyepiece adapter for further adjustment of eyepiece orientation. I find the convenient eyepiece positioning on the SCT to be superior to the contortions needed with the 10-inch Dob mounted Newtonian. For safety I have the BV assembly tethered to the SCT optical tube. I don't want to risk an expensive accident.With the SCT the total light path is around 215 mm.. So the first quarter Moon was spectacular. The seeing wasn't good enough to insert the Barlow lens. But the 160X magnification without it was appropriate for conditions. Among the interesting features that could be discerned were the Huyinus rille and the network of shallow rilles near Triesnecker. Being able to stand in a relaxed position allowed for comfortable viewing. My eyes and mind were able to just ""drink"" the scene as presented. After some 50 years of using just my right eye for observing, it will the some time for the left eye to make up for what it hasn't learned about seeing faint objects and fine detail.

654,loa 21s on the way,"I viewed it a couple of weeks ago.. The result is going to depend a great deal on the scope.  In the 12"" dob, I found it to be much more fun than in the SV110ED.. With the LOAs, the way the stars are distributed over the field can make a huge difference.. If most of the target is concentrated over the center array, the view will look artificial to some degree because the shape of the array will show (a square recess in the center of the field is set to ""Far""). This was the effect with the SV110ED.. In the 12"", the view was much different because the stars were more evenly spread across the field, and this meant stars spread over more array elements. The view was much more pleasing in the 12"". I am finding this to be very much the case.  With the LOAs it is not about ""Framing"" so much as it is about magnitude, density, and distribution, and an object that looks amazing in one scope (or at one magnification) can appear unnatural in another scope where most of the stars are just filling up the central array with a few spreading out from it. Power Switch system makes it very easy to flip though different distributions to find the best effect. Single power users are going to have to barlow/down to get a different distribution.. Don't get me wrong. I really like the LOAs, but the way a particular object appears will be greatly influenced by the way the density is spread across the array. Some objects will look weird because they will look like a green carpet in a sunken living room. Best targets are targets that have dimmer stars that fill the center 50% to 80% of the view, and small targets like M57, in a field of faint stars. Planetary nebula in faint star fields will be dazzling.. I am finding myself using the D21s for general viewing and have learned to recognize when a target will look good in 3D, and I swap in the LOAs.. It is just like any other eyepiece.  You would not want to use a 31mm Nagler in a 12"" dob to view M13 when a 7mm Nagler will blow it wide open. Likewise, you won't want to use the LOAs on some targets.. Don't expect the LOAs to be the right choice for every target because they won't be (at least not to me). When the target is right though, the result is pretty amazing..",5,5

I just grabbed my C102 that's bino friendly and I get a fairly wide view using mt WO with no OCS. So right after it got somewhat dark, I looked at Saturn. In the LOA it looked sharp, but way to small to get a good view. I switched out the BV and went with a 6.7mm for 150x and had a nice glimpse of the Cassini division. So looking east, I could now see the clouds coming in, but the SW was still clear and dark enough out to see the teapot stars. Put the LOA's back in and panned the area with my 9x50's for a fuzzball. Oh, there's one, lets see what I got in the EP? Good one, M17 the Swan nebula! Sure enough it was floating a bit in front of the surround stars.....kind cool. I wished it was a little darker out to see more detail, but not enough time.

So for me, changing eyepeices for planets would not be a big deal because when seeing is good, I do that anyway.. I too am curious about light transmission.. If you can ""Turn the effect off"" though and the transmission goes back to normal, then there would be no loss, but I suspect that this may not be the case (if there is any transmission loss, which we don't know yet)..

I wonder how large is the maximum induced parallax. To be clearly discernible to the point of suggesting real depth, minumum parallax would have to be at least a couple or several times one's retinal resolving power of 1-2 arcminutes. For a readily sensed range of depth, parallax should encompass something approaching one degree, I should think. This makes me wonder how such a differential would exhibit itself when at or near the so-called 'zero parallax, 90 degree' orientation, where objects seen through the array could have a vertical displacement with respect to the other eyepiece image, giving the impression of mis-collimation..

I am sure you will be blown away, but just to make sure, spend a week observing with a small 4"" scope with just one eye and then go with the 16"" and two eyes so you have a point of reference as to how awesome your views truly are with the 16""..",5,4
674,binoviewers omg binoviewers,"Me, too! I was looking at the rille near Aristarchus last Thursday night, and it is seared into my mind's eye. I gotta see it again, but not tonight. Clouds and rain even come sometimes to the desert.. /Ira.",4,5
675,binoviewers omg binoviewers,"Agreed!  The full moon is a hoot via the binos.. My very first use of a binoviewer in the early 1980's ( the Celestron viewer) was with a one off 7"" f15 AP triplet and a pair of Celestron 26 MM silver tops.  I was struck by the incredible detail even without shadows to enhance contrast but also the incredible range of subtle colors, the browns, tans, grays, whites, silver blues and so forth.  I'd NEVER seen such a color tapestry before on the moon.. One of those ""TA-DAH"" moments.. Jeff.",5,5
676,binoviewers omg binoviewers,"Just one of those is probably more expensive than all the equipment I presently own, so I do not see any sense in getting those at this time, since the optics in the BVs will probably be better than that of my scope. I was looking at Celestron's, which go for around $189 and open out to 75mm. If I decide to get anything, it will be those.. Thanks..",4,3
677,binoviewers omg binoviewers,"I guess I must be a true lunatic, because I've never found it difficult to navigate the full Moon, nor have I ever found it blinding. I can look at it in my 12"" dob at only 75x and I didn't find it to be all that bright. OK, it wasn't more than 20° above horizon, but it was a clear night. But then I didn't try to maintain night vision either and had my outdoor lights on. Haven't any of you tried to make it a sport to identify craters and rilles under high sun? Try Rimae Huygens. It's visible as a white streak across the terrain. How about crater Ptolemaeus? Can you see the craters on its floor? How many? How about the bright crater dots in Plato? Can you see the terraces in Copernicus? Or Tycho? The dark streaks on the inside of Aristarch? Craters and white streaks across Mare Smythii and Mare Marginis?. I could go on and on. Much of this is well within the range of a 60mm, though it's decidely easier in a 5"". Clear skies!. Thomas, Denmark.",4,2
678,binoviewers omg binoviewers,"What EP's where you using and the power you were at with the bino's. For my set up I'm about 120 with the 20mm EP's. Thanks,. Bob.",4,2
679,binoviewers omg binoviewers,"With the worrisome concerns about available in-focus travel when striving for the widest FOV/largest exit pupils for deep-sky observation, why not modify or build a scope dedicated for BV usage?. If I was not a true bino nut, I'd most definitely cobble up something like a newt having the fastest f/ratio which could be accommodated by the chosen BV. The aperture would be dictated by the distance required for swing-through of the bottom end when the eyepiece is at a fixed height for a comfortably seated eye height. In other words, the altitude pivot would be at the eyepiece, and a counterweight rod would extend out in front of the OTA. No adjustable-height seat required.. I'd even consider cutting down the tube on a refractor. And shortening the focuser's drawtube. (I can just hear the collective gasps engendered by this heresy!) If doing binoviewing, why not go all the way?.",4,3

682,custom smooth barrel adapter for baader hyperion mk iii,"I am also interested in a pair of ""smoothies"" assuming the price is not outrageous. I too have alignment issues in my MaxBright BVs. I'm looking forward to seeing how this works out.. Thanks for taking a crack at this Gary!.",4,2
683,custom smooth barrel adapter for baader hyperion mk iii,"Just a comment on how much issue I was having.. There were a few times where viewing Jupiter at 440x (8mm setting on the zooms) I had so much trouble getting the eyepieces to merge because of sagging that I found myself having to use the collimation collars on the Binotron to manually push the eyepiece towers around.. I hosed up the collimation so bad that I just ordered a Collitron from Russ so I can start over.. He had sent me Collitron once to try out, and I liked it, but thought the price was a bit high, but it was so nice to use, and it made getting collimation so easy that I just decided that I would get one and bright the system back to perfect again.. The point is that this was how much problem I had with the undercuts. The eyepieces would squirm around when I zoomed in and out, and I was constantly having to fuss with them and at 8mm setting, it was really aggravating to get the image to merge. No matter how tight I had the compression collet down, the eyepieces would tilt.. Hugely excited about this.. Regards,Ed.",2,3
684,custom smooth barrel adapter for baader hyperion mk iii,"Gary,. Your list indicates 1 adapter for me but I had requested 2 adapters. Thanks.",2,1

686,custom smooth barrel adapter for baader hyperion mk iii,"Thanks for the tutorial Eddgie, I will give them a try again tomorrow evening. Part of the reason for my quick test was to confirm that I have enough nose room to use the zooms. I do, but just..

687,custom smooth barrel adapter for baader hyperion mk iii,"I talked with my machinist friend, Pierre.. I have the production quote costs based on 10 unit increments.. Prices have been converted to US funds.. If we can get more orders, the cost/per unit will decrease to the following:. Order of 10 units: cost per unit will be $33.00 US funds =  5 orders of 2. Order of 20 units: cost per unit will be $25.00 US funds = 10 orders or 2. Order of 30 units: cost per unit will be $22.00 US funds = 15 orders of 2. I have received an interest in 8 and possibly 10 units.. I hope we can achieve at least an order for 20 units !! Shipping will be via Canada Post bubble wrap fixed at $10.00 US for a pair of adapters (Canada & USA - CONUS) & $12.00 US for international This is the least expensive method but there is no tracking or insurance. I used this mailing method last year for my Baader to Denk adapter project and all adapters arrived safely worldwide (USA, Australia, and Europe).. As before, I'll need a confirmation email for those who are interested. Send me a PM or make a post on this Forum's topic.. I'll keep a running total for those are interested and see what total commitment we arrive at.. I'll ask that payment be made in advance and will only ask for payment once we have reached our final total to determine the actual cost/unit.. PayPal works best for me (use friends and family, i.e. PP fees paid by the purchaser).. Gary.",4,1
688,custom smooth barrel adapter for baader hyperion mk iii,"The key to using the zooms for viewing is to screw the diopters down tight.. Use the focuser to focus for one eye, then use slip focusing on the other eyepeice (which will be far easier with smooth side barrel). Now you will be able to zoom both eyepieces at once using one hand on either housing.. The only binoviewers that don't have this issue are the Mark V, Binotron and ones that have only compression holders with no diopter adjustment like the Televue Bino Vue.. Almost all of the the others will have this problem where the diopter turns requireing one hand to hold and one hand to zoom.. Again, just run the diopters all the way down and finger tight, then slip focus for one eyepeice, and you are good to go.. Again, one of the things that makes the Mar V so excellent. It will center just about anything (including ES undercuts) and locks up tight. Excellent with zooms.. But for adjustable diopter units, this trick works fine, allowing one hand zoom (or two hand, two eyepeice zoom at the same time)..",4,3
689,custom smooth barrel adapter for baader hyperion mk iii,"***** FINAL UPDATE *****. All the adapters produced are in their new owners hands - all arrived safely !!. Thank you everyone. I am contemplating making smooth barrels for the ES24mm 68* eyepiece in Stainless Steel and aluminum smooth barrels for the ES20mm & ES16mm eyepiece (these are the same design for each version) - if there is any interest let me know,.

692,denk binotron first light,I believe that is correct.  OCSs usually act like barlows multiplying power to be able to focus..,4,2
693,denk binotron first light,"Well it doesn't hurt to try...  I mean, I believe you Jeff, it certainly should work with the barlow switch, just never tried it before...  If we can just get some decent weather here, it's been cold and damp for days..",2,2
694,denk binotron first light,"I'm putting them head to had when I get mine, B27 v. MkV, and may the best man win.  There are several areas where I know the new B27 will win on ergonomics - diopters for instance. I owned a Denk II for a few years and I still miss those beautiful diopters, the MkV is just not the same for me.  And the new diopters are supposed to be even better.  The PowerSwitch is another bonus simply for being able to achieve 1.3X in a fast dob, the best I can get with my MkVs is 1.7X.  Another area with improvement over the MkV is the actual connection, I have never been comfortable with that dovetail/single thumbscrew arrangement of the MkV.  Yes the Quick Changer gives me flexibility but it could have been done more securely, i.e. the Baader Maxbright..",4,3
695,denk binotron first light,"Right on..and Aloha! Nice report, nothing like a good, comfortable pair of binocs for viewing. My experience is daytime scenic/hunting scenarios, like most people I suppose, and the higher end glass, if you're fortunate enough to own, really is a pleasure to use. And that's what I was hoping, in considering these binotrons. You know, I'm 50 yrs. old & started this astronomy hobby 2 yrs. past, I like the fact when using a scope, you bow your head when you look to the sky, and sometimes just look up, take it all in. I didn't know much of these astronomy things were even availiable to most people...so thanks again..",5,3

698,denk binotron first light,The ZAOs were not necessarily bested but they were too much power for conditions last night. I also found once again that the Brandons displayed less scatter on Saturn.  The Pans are nice but the Brandons are clearly better on axis and show a darker background and much flatter field. I like the Pans though for DSOs and for giving me the widest possible field. All eyepieces were sharp to the edge in the B27s/OCS-A45..,4,5
699,denk binotron first light,"Johnny, Jeff is correct!  The Barlow ""Slider"" essentially acts as an OCS would in creating the needed out focus that's being eaten up by the added optical path of the Binoviewers.. I used this trick on a C6R once when I forgot the OCS at home.. Mike.",4,3
